https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-joins-goodwill-recycling-program/,"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this again Microsoft joins Dell in making Goodwill a nationwide repository for free electronics recycling through its Reconnect program.Microsoft announced Wednesday its joining Dell and Goodwill Industries International in their ongoing recycling program.Goodwill, in addition to being a used clothing and furniture repository and store, is also a place where people can drop off their old electronics.Through a program started in partnership with Dell in 2004 called Reconnect, participating Goodwill centers allow people to drop off their used computers and related peripherals to be recycled for free.You can now add Microsoft products like Zunes and Xboxes to the list of electronic items Goodwill accepts.The program is not completely convenient as there are many states in the U.S. that don't have participating Reconnect locations.(The closest one to me is more than 30 miles away.)But it does offer 1,900 Reconnect Goodwill drop-offs in the U.S. and in early April expanded to include drop-offs in Ontario and Quebec, Canada.The electronics are evaluated by Goodwill employees.Viable electronics are resold, those in need of repair or beyond repair are sent out to be refurbished or broken down and recycled.While the intentions are good and the program claims to have ""diverted more than 96 million pounds of e-waste from landfills"" since inception, it's dubious how successful it can be in motivating people to drop off their stuff.A recent electronics recycling poll conducted by Pike Research found that the average consumer has 2.8 pieces of electronics junk stashed somewhere in their home, and that 35 percent of consumers believe there should be curbside pick-up service along with their regular trash.Still, if you have a Reconnect Goodwill nearby, it may be one of the best e-waste recycling options available if your old e-waste product doesn't qualify for a rebate program like the online HP Consumer Buyback program.Staples offers free recycling of keyboards, mice, speakers, and Dell products, and $3 coupons in exchange for used ink cartridges.But it charges a $10 fee for ""all other brands of computer monitors, desktop and laptop computers, printers, scanners, all-in-ones and fax machines.""Office Depot offers all-you-can-fill recycling boxes that come in $5, $10, and $15 options.Dell also offers a free pick-up option through its Dell PRP Recycling Program in conjunction with FedEx.As for Apple users looking to recycle, your options are free take-back when you buy your next Apple product, free recycling and drop-off options in select states, or a $30 fee for the mail-in program.As always, all consumers should remember to wipe hard drives clean before unleashing their old tech to the world.Updated 10:30 a.m. PDT: New info included concerning Dell's free pick-up option.The Lion King remake brings renewed life to a Disney classic: Jon Favreau's version offers incredibly lifelike characters, but at what cost?SDCC, the biggest convention ever, had a very small start: What started as a gathering in a basement has exploded into one of the world's biggest cultural blowouts.Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic.We delete comments that violate our policy, which we encourage you to read.Discussion threads can be closed at any time at our discretion."

https://unfccc.int/news/how-microsofts-carbon-fee-is-driving-climate-action-forward,"Since the Paris Agreement to limit global carbon emissions was ratified, countries must now figure out how to fulfill their individual climate pledges and meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).NDCs are national climate action plans under the Paris Agreement that cover both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building resilience to the inevitable impacts of climate change.Carbon pricing has emerged as one of the most popular and effective ways to make progress on the NDCs.Already, about 40 national governments have a price on carbon, covering 12 percent of global emissions.And nearly half of the pledged NDCs include a reference to carbon pricing.The private sector has a wealth of experience to offer countries that are considering putting a price on carbon.One of the corporate pioneers in this space is Microsoft.Microsoft received a Momentum for Change Lighthouse Activity Award at COP21 for its innovative carbon program, and spoke at COP22 about how others can adopt this effective model.“The fee has helped establish a culture of sustainability in our company,” said TJ DiCaprio, Senior Director of Environmental Sustainability at Microsoft and the chief architect behind the company’s carbon fee.“Sustainability is now an expectation of our leadership for how we operate our datacenters and facilities.”Since implementing its carbon fee in July 2012, Microsoft has reduced its emissions by more than 9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e), invested in more than 14 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of green power, and has had a positive impact on more than 7 million people through carbon offset community project investments.The impact of the Microsoft carbon fee since it was implemented in 2012 Microsoft first introduced its carbon fee when it made a company-wide commitment to operate net carbon neutral in 2012.The fee holds Microsoft internal business groups financially accountable for the carbon emissions associated with their operations.Through the fee, Microsoft generates the funds to pay for the cost of carbon neutrality and works to advance the following goals: To help achieve this, Microsoft invests its carbon fee fund in four areas: First, the company dedicates a significant portion to renewable energy, helping to increase its reliance on clean power and expanding the renewable energy market worldwide.Second, it invests in carbon offset community projects—particularly in the areas where it operates datacenters—to offset its emissions while supporting sustainable development.Third, it uses the fund to drive internal and external climate-related energy and technology innovation.And finally, the company sets aside a portion for “track-and-report” projects, helping to ensure transparency and accountability through its carbon program.Microsoft green power purchases (learn more through an interactive Bing map) Microsoft carbon offset community investments (learn more through an interactive Bing map)Microsoft designed its carbon fee model to be easy to replicate.The company has published several white papers describing its goals and providing detailed guidance for other organizations interested in using the model.TJ DiCaprio (left), participating in the Momentum for Change: Climate Friendly Investments session at COP22, during which she also highlighted the launch of the latest Microsoft carbon program white paper, “Beyond carbon neutral: Expanding beyond our carbon neutral operations to accelerate global and local good.”“At Microsoft, we are committed to taking significant action to tackle climate change,” said Ms. DiCaprio.“We do this in part by carefully investing our carbon fee fund into carbon-neutral projects that will accelerate energy and technology innovation.We do it in part by operating carbon neutral and running our business as efficiently as possible.And we do it by sharing the lessons we have learned over the years to help others benefit from our experience.”"

March 21, 2018 | Microsoft News Center REDMOND, Wash. — March 21, 2018 — Microsoft Corp. announced on Wednesday the purchase of 315 MW of energy from Pleinmont I and II, two new solar projects in the commonwealth of Virginia.This represents the single largest corporate purchase of solar energy ever in the United States.This will enable Microsoft to make significant progress toward its goal of reaching 60 percent by early 2020.The Pleinmont projects are part of a larger 500-MW solar development, owned and operated by sPower, an AES and AIMCo company.“Today, we’re signing the largest corporate solar agreement in the United States, a 315 megawatt project in Virginia that will move us ahead of schedule in creating a cleaner cloud,” said Brad Smith, president, Microsoft.“This project means more than just gigawatts, because our commitment is broader than transforming our own operations; it’s also about helping others access more renewable energy.” The project is owned and will be operated by sPower, a leading independent renewable energy power producer based in Salt Lake City, Utah.Once operational, Pleinmont I and II will consist of more than 750,000 solar panels spread across more than 2,000 acres, and produce approximately 715,000 MWh a year.“Microsoft’s participation is a game-changer for this project and for other buyers,” said Ryan Creamer, CEO of sPower.“Their early commitment helped ensure that the project continued to move forward and come to fruition at a time of regulatory uncertainty.Microsoft’s large off-take also helped us offer very cost-competitive options for other buyers looking at our Virginia portfolios.This model broadens the ability for buyers of all sizes to participate in a large project like this, yet only take the megawatts they need for their business goals.We’re proud to be working with Microsoft on this innovative approach.” At 500 MW, the full project will be the largest solar project in Virginia and is equal to the entire amount of solar power currently produced in the commonwealth.It will also rank as the fifth largest solar project in the country.Microsoft has a sizeable presence in Virginia, both in terms of its physical presence in the form of datacenters and office buildings and its work to bring connectivity to all citizens in the form of broadband technology.This is its second solar power purchase in Virginia.“Today’s announcement demonstrates that Virginia is quickly becoming a global leader in the clean energy industry,” said Governor Ralph Northam.“When companies like Microsoft invest in Virginia solar, they opt for clean and reliable energy as well as new jobs in the energy economy we are working hard to build.I am proud that Microsoft is expanding its commitment to solar energy in Virginia, and I look forward to building upon this victory for clean energy and the jobs that come with it.” This deal also represents two milestones for the company.With recent deals, Microsoft has met its target to power at least 50 percent of its datacenters with clean energy by 2018.This deal marks the first step toward its next goal of achieving 60 percent by early 2020.The size of the deal also puts Microsoft’s total of directly purchased renewable energy at roughly 1.2 gigawatts — enough power to send Marty McFly back in time in a DeLorean.Microsoft (Nasdaq “MSFT” @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.For more information, press only: Microsoft Media Relations, WE Communications for Microsoft, (425) 638-7777, rrt@we-worldwide.com Note to editors: For more information, news and perspectives from Microsoft, please visit the Microsoft News Center at http://news.microsoft.com.Web links, telephone numbers and titles were correct at time of publication, but may have changed.For additional assistance, journalists and analysts may contact Microsoft’s Rapid Response Team or other appropriate contacts listed at https://news.microsoft.com/microsoft-public-relations-contacts.Follow us: Share this page:"

https://www.cnet.com/news/dont-bank-on-sonys-aibo-robot-dog-being-your-dogs-best-friend/,"CNET también está disponible en español.Don't show this again Dogs aren't quite sure about Sony's robo-pup.Aibo is getting some serious side-eye from Essie.We've already seen how people form attachments with Aibo.Now we want to know how dogs feel about Sony's $2,900 robo-pup.To find out, I ventured to Nashville, Tennessee, where associate certified applied animal behaviorist Ellen Mahurin lives and works.Ellen treats dogs with behavioral problems like aggression and fearfulness using stuffed animals.There's conflicting research about the effect tech has on our furry friends.Dogs are sensitive to certain sounds that can negatively impact their health, according to a 2005 report.Flickers in LED lights that are imperceptible to humans can also cause problems.I didn't come across any Aibo-specific research that said its vaguely dog-like noises or OLED eyes could hurt dogs, but an unpublished Sony study claims the opposite -- that dogs form bonds with Aibo robots that aid in their development.Today, Ellen and I are meeting with Devin Komline, owner of dog daycare center Nashville Tail Blazers, to see for ourselves.Six of his customers agreed to lend us their pups for the afternoon, to introduce them to Aibo -- with Ellen on hand to provide expert commentary.She's interested to see how dogs of different ages, breeds and personalities feel about Aibo, especially since Sony's robot can move around and make noise.Those are two variables she hasn't tested before in her own consultations.""I suspect they're going to be a little fearful of Aibo at first, but I'll be looking for some specific dog-to-dog greetings that they might do, some comfortness, some dog behavior, and I'll be interested to see how they do,"" Ellen says.If all goes well, Ellen could potentially use Aibo in her work as a dog behaviorist.These dogs weren't quite sure what to make of Sony's robot pup.We met in an empty building under construction, the future site of Devin's new daycare facility.It's where we will introduce the dogs from Tail Blazers to Aibo in groups of three.But first, Ellen makes sure the dogs walk around the space without Aibo present so they're used to it.Soon after, chaos ensues.Essie, a three-and-and-a-half-year-old cocker spaniel/poodle/schnauzer mix is first up.She approaches the stationary robot and sniffs its butt, but quickly backs away.""She's cautious, didn't expect it to move, I think,"" Ellen explains.She says Essie isn't quite sure what Aibo is, but doesn't think it's *too* scary.Five-month-old boxer mix, Bronx, barrels into the room and jets straight for Aibo, barking at it.Ellen says she's seen similar reactions when dogs come into contact with robot vacuums, something I've also seen firsthand with my own dogs.Mushu is up next.He's an eight-month-old Australian shepherd who is deaf, so Aibo's sounds won't bother him.Mushu goes straight up to the bot and sniffs it, but quickly becomes cautious as it starts to move and never ventures near it again.Ellen says all three of these reactions are standard, roughly what she'd expect when a dog encounters a robot like Aibo for the first time.Each one displayed curiosity coupled with uncertainty -- they weren't sure what to make of Aibo.""I think they would need some time to get comfortable with the way it [Aibo] moves and how it sounds and be able to ignore that and then start some social interaction,"" Ellen explains.The second group reacts similarly to the first.Henry, a standard poodle, approaches Aibo first.He has stiff body language, Ellen tells me, but she notices a subtle ""play bow"" from Henry toward Aibo -- a way dogs communicate with one another to show they want to play.Barkley, a Bernese mountain dog, shows little interest in Aibo and Willow, a pit bull, appears to ignore Aibo, but licks her lips.Ellen explains that it's a stress signal when a dog licks their lips.""The movements are not natural enough for them to feel comfortable,"" she adds.Aibo, meet Bumba.To get a sense of a longer-term interaction with Aibo, CNET video producer, Vanessa Salas, also introduced her dog, Bumba, a shih zu and bichon mix to Aibo over the course of 12 days.Vanessa recorded some of the interactions between Bumba and Aibo, and we played them for Ellen.As the days progress, Bumba got more comfortable with Aibo, but they certainly didn't become friends.In one clip, Bumba goes near Aibo to pick up one of her toys, an indication that she thinks Aibo might be able to take it from her.Even so, Ellen doesn't think Bumba sees Aibo as a dog.While Sony's Aibo study indicates a close bond between dogs and Aibo, our own unofficial study suggests otherwise.Chris Benham, an Aibo owner from Burlington, Wisconsin, says his two dogs destroyed his first Aibo bot.He and his wife, Paula Cooper, got home one day and discovered their Aibo badly scratched and missing an ear and its tail.""You can't blame the dogs, because to them it was just another plastic toy on the ground,"" Chris explains.He trained his dogs to leave their new Aibo alone this go-round, and they do largely ignore it.Their cat, Griff, curls up next to the Aibo while it's charging.They think it's because the charger gets warm.Another Aibo owner, Chris Werfel, observed a similar sort of interaction between his niece's dog and his own Aibo, named Baby.""It was really interesting to see the puppy Welsh corgi walk up to Baby, sniff his backside, and then look away with this incredulous look on his face,"" he says.Baby turned around and barked at the corgi, leaving him wondering if Aibo can recognize other dogs.""I'm not sure what was going on inside his tiny computer brain, but it [Baby] seems to have some ability to interact with other dogs,"" he adds.Sony tells me Aibo can actually recognize real dogs.Ellen doesn't think dogs recognize Aibo as one of their own, though.There is an inherent curiosity, though, and if Bumba is any indication, dogs can get used to Aibo over time.Just don't expect them to be best buds.These are the best coolers you can buy: If you enjoy a frosty beverage on a hot, sunny day, then you'll need a dependable cooler this summer.Here are our top picks out of the 18 that we've tested.The best

with the support of government grants from SEAI, have initiated an innovative low-carbon community engagement project that will help to improve the school’s energy efficiency capabilities and deliver energy savings to Collinstown Park Community College in Clondalkin, Dublin every year.This innovative and sustainable project successfully combines the expertise, capabilities and resources of SSE Airtricity’s Business Energy Solutions division and the Microsoft datacentre team.As part of the project, SSE Airtricity has installed modern low-carbon infrastructure across the Collinstown Park Community College campus, whilst Microsoft has matched the grant funding provided by SEAI, resulting in a total project investment of €250,000 for the school.The total project funding has been utilised to upgrade the school’s energy efficiency capabilities, including an LED lighting upgrade of the full campus; the installation of roof-mounted solar PV panels that will generate energy up to 8,000KWh of green energy per annum to be consumed on-site; and associated battery storage units that allow the energy generated by the solar panels to be stored when not required for later use.In addition to annual energy cost savings, further energy innovation research will be enabled through the planned analysis by Microsoft and SSE Airtricity of energy generation data collected remotely from the installed solar PV and battery installations.Live, real-time monitoring of solar PV and battery interaction as well as the school’s energy use will help improve industry insight into how the generation and storage technologies interface, as well as inform improvements to solar forecasting accuracy.At the core of the Collinstown Park Community College community engagement project is a strong education component designed by SSE Airtricity, Microsoft and SEAI to inform students, staff and parents about renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency.Student and teacher understanding of the deployed technology will be supported by digital screens installed by Microsoft throughout the school to show energy use data in real-time in an easy-to-interpret format.Collinstown Park Community College students and teachers will also participate in an energy efficiency awareness campaign that will include participating in SSE Airtricity’s ‘21 Day Challenge’ – this will help the school community to establish energy reduction habits through positive sustainability actions.Participating students will also be equipped with home energy saving kits, empowering the young energy citizens to promote greater energy use awareness in the home.Stephen Gallagher, Director of Business Energy for SSE Ireland, said: “SSE Airtricity is delighted to partner with Microsoft to deliver this truly innovative project.It successfully combines energy efficiency with the integration of renewable energy and battery storage infrastructure, as well as an educational awareness programme for the school, to create an outstanding community engagement project that will also deliver real annual energy and cost savings.Additionally, we’re really excited to see how the energy-saving tools installed at Collinstown Park Community College will enable future learning, both for the school community as well as for SSE Airtricity and Microsoft.” Eoin Doherty, Microsoft Regional Datacentre Director for Europe, Middle East, and Africa, said: “Building strong communities through partnerships and local engagement is an essential part of the Microsoft ethos.We are proud to partner with SSE Airtricity and SEAI on this project to benefit Collinstown Park Community College.This project appealed to Microsoft specifically because of the educational aspects of the projects that will teach Collinstown Park students how to incorporate environmental sustainability habits into their everyday lives.” Jim Gannon, Chief Executive of the SEAI, said: ""SEAI is pleased to support through the Communities programme the energy retrofit project at Collinstown Park.To date €125 million in community grants has underpinned over €300 million investment in upgrades to 17,500 homes, 2000 non-domestic buildings.The annual energy savings are estimated in excess of €50 million.SEAI’s community activities are designed to help people to become more informed, enabled and in control of their own low carbon future.""Our community energy network has more than 230-member communities across the country.We help them to create their own plan for a low carbon future for their community and provide support for the capital projects within this plan.This most recent tranche of Government of Ireland funding supports those communities who have identified the priority projects to help them save money and play their part in tackling climate change.SEAI’s 2019 Community Programme is now open for applications.""The Collinstown Park Community College community engagement project delivered by SSE Airtricity and Microsoft, together with the support of SEAI, contains three key elements: The overall project was delivered by SSE Airtricity alongside the company’s strategic partners Activ8 Solar Energies and Verde LED who installed the key solar and lighting elements to enable the innovative energy efficiency infrastructure.As well as acting as a secondary school setting, Collinstown Park Community College campus serves a wider purpose within the local community.All year round the sports hall offers vital services for sports and leisure, and the school is also an adult education facility.Tomorrow marks Global Wind Day, a worldwide event that occurs annually on 15 June.It is a day for discovering wind energy, its power and the possibilities it holds to reshape our energy systems, decarbonise our economies, and boost jobs and growth.A new energy ambition to meet our net zero goal SSE Airtricity, Ireland’s largest provider of 100% green energy, has handed out more than €12,000 to community groups near its Knockastanna Wind Farm close to the Limerick and Tipperary border.This year’s Community Fund brings the company’s overall contribution in the region to €144,749 since 2010.ALMOST €145,000 NOW AWARDED TO COMMUNITY GROUPS IN TIPPERARY AND LIMERICK BY SSE AIRTRICITY Following the publication of SSE's full year preliminary results, we look at the performance of the company's renewable energy assets in the UK and Ireland, and its development options in core markets and internationally, including new onshore and offshore wind.Operating and Investing in

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-carbonoffset-companies/microsoft-disney-among-companies-calculating-carbon-footprints-report-idUSKCN1BN2TY,"3 Min Read NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Microsoft, Walt Disney Co. and General Motors are among hundreds of companies calculating how much they spend on carbon emissions to show investors they are concerned about global warming, a study said on Tuesday.More than 700 other businesses around the world plan by 2018 to introduce so-called carbon pricing, said the report by the U.S.-based Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES).The findings come amid efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to scale back climate change-related regulations on grounds they are burdensome to the economy.Putting a monetary value on carbon dioxide emissions helps limit the burning of fossil fuel, which contributes to global warming, and signals to investors that companies are aware of the financial risks posed by global warming, the study said.Some 500 companies, including 80 in the United States, reported using carbon pricing, it said, drawing on an array of previous research.Many oil and gas companies such as British energy company BP use an internal, or “shadow,” accounting method to track their carbon emissions, it said.“It just stands to reason that investors, in looking at enterprises, of course are looking at ‘Are they resilient to all kinds of changes in the future?’” Bob Stout, vice president for BP America, said during a telephone briefing with reporters and others.“Climate change and carbon pricing as a policy obviously are key factors that businesses need to look at,” he said.Other companies charge carbon fees to internal business units.Microsoft, which charges its business units for emissions ranging from electricity consumption to employee air travel, sees carbon pricing as crucial “regardless of national policies,” said Liz Willmott, a company program manager.“We as companies can enable partnership and collaborations with countries to help them meet the Paris targets,” she said.Trump has withdrawn the United States from the historic 2015 Paris global agreement to fight climate change, saying the accord would cost the nation trillions of dollars, kill jobs and hinder oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries.According to the World Bank, 42 governments have or plan to have a way to tax carbon emissions or have a cap-and-trade system that allows industries with low emissions to sell their unused permitted capacity to larger emitters.The United States is not among them.Reporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Katy Migiro and Ellen Wulfhorst.Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.Visit news.trust.org All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.© 2019 Reuters.All Rights Reserved."

commitments, Europe sets ambitious goals for the reduction of carbon emissions.Because wind and solar projects are time and capital intensive, this goal can only be met if the combination of renewable energy sources become possible.Industrial wood pellets from the southern United States are already helping Europe to develop a low-carbon economy that meets its renewable energy targets.This techno...logy will help utilities balance the grid as they increase their reliance on solar and wind energy.Industrial wood pellets can be quickly deployed to fill gaps in supply, and easily adjusted to meet daily fluctuations in energy demand.Wood pellets are the only readily available source of renewable energy that is capable of providing consistent energy to meet the demand.This renewable resource can also be used in the same furnaces that currently fire coal with minimal investments needed, enabling utilities to use existing infrastructure without having to spend billions on new technologies and new facilities.This reduces emissions while keeping electricity rates low and stable for consumers.References: USIPA-MediaKit-2017 http://www.theusipa.org/media #USBioenergy #usa🇺🇸

sustainability should be the top priority to achieve the necessary emissions game change in today’s world.It is essential to focus on fundamentals of noxious emissions of wood pellets versus coal.Environmental Benefits of Wood Pellets: • Wood pellets are carbon neutral (if the source of it does not involve elimination of current forestry).... • Switching from coal to natural gas reduces 50% of greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions, while switching from coal to wood pellets reduces 100% of GHG emissions.Wood pellets say “NO” to: • carbon dioxide • sulphur oxides • nitrogen oxides • chlorine • metals (including arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, lead and mercury).• In the EU, around 5% of energy consumption is from bioenergy.EC projections suggest that biomass use will double, supplying half of the total contribution for reaching the 20% renewable energy target in 2020.But European utilities are unwilling to wait for the European Commission’s decision.Seven of the largest utilities, along with Canadian, European, and U.S. pellet associations, are actively working through the IWPB toward a mandatory universal sustainability verification scheme, where one of the key principles proposed is “Carbon dioxide savings must be significant, i.e.greater than 60% versus fossil fuels.” To meet these goals we need to look at the wood pellets as the potential solution, while working on refining the best possible environmentally safe sources of wood pellets industry.Reference: https://www.pellet.org/wpac-…/sustainable-biomass-production #USBioenergy #usa🇺🇸 #bioenergy

energy sources, such as solar, tidal or wind energy, are promising approaches but so far, they are neither effective nor flexible enough to replace energy from conventional combustion on a global scale.Since neither energy saving efforts nor alternative energy sources are likely to prevail in the next future, wood pellets is the best approach to reduce and stabilize greenhouse gas

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/25/facebook-video-spreads-climate-denial-misinformation-to-5-million-users,"Facebook is still struggling to contain its fake news problem Dana Nuccitelli Wed 25 Jul 2018 11.00 BST Last modified on Wed 25 Jul 2018 22.36 BST Marc Morano is the real-world fossil fuel industry version of Nick Naylor.His career began working for Rush Limbaugh, followed by a job at Cybercast News Service where he launched the ‘Swift Boat’ attacks on 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.In 2006, Morano became the director of communications for Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), who is perhaps best known for throwing a snowball on the Senate floor and calling human-caused global warming “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.” Thus it’s unsurprising that in 2009, Morano began directing fossil fuel-funded think tanks designed to cast doubt on the reality of and dangers associated with human-caused global warming.As he admitted in Merchants of Doubt, Morano frequently embodies the strategy of climate denial known as ‘fake experts’: Most recently, Morano created a short video that centers on three common climate myths and has garnered over 5m views on Facebook.Morano begins his video by denying the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming.Consensus denial is one of the most popular climate myths, and was the subject of the most widely-shared climate story of 2016.Morano’s strategy is to critique two of the studies that found a 97% expert consensus.One, published in 2009 by Peter Doran and Maggie Zimmerman surveyed 3,146 Earth scientists, but fewer than 80 of the participants were actively publishing climate science research (and hence experts on the subject).Basically, the critique is that the study sample size was too small to make a conclusive determination about the level of expert consensus.That’s a valid point, except this was just one among many such climate consensus studies.In fact, the authors of seven separate consensus studies using a variety of approaches (some with very large sample sizes) teamed up in 2016 to publish a paper concluding that the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is between 90 and 100%.So, this critique is invalid when considering all the available consensus research.Morano also critiques the consensus study that my colleagues and I published in 2013.He does so simply by quoting economist Richard Tol saying our 97% figure “was pulled from thin air.” Tol argued that the methodology in our study was flawed, but when we applied his critiques in a follow-up paper published in 2014, we found that the consensus was still 97 ± 1%.Moreover, Tol himself has said, “The consensus is of course in the high nineties” and “There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans.I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct.” In short, Morano’s only evidence to dispute the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is to quote an economist who agrees the consensus is 90–100%, and that the experts are correct that humans are responsible for global warming.Next in the video, Morano claims that we’re not actually in the midst of the hottest period on record, and that ‘hottest year’ claims are “merely political statements” because for example, he claims, scientists can’t say with 100% certainty that 2016 was hotter than 2015 due to the margin of uncertainty in the data.This claim is similar to one made on Fox News that earned a ‘Pants on Fire’ rating from Politifact based on consultation with climate scientists.2014 through 2017 are indeed the four hottest years on record, outside the range of uncertainty.Morano concludes the video by claiming “the most outrageous myth of all is that carbon dioxide is somehow the control knob of the climate.” Ironically, Nasa climate scientists published a paper in 2010 titled, “Atmospheric CO2: Principal Control Knob Governing Earth’s Temperature.” Morano argues that the experts are wrong because there are hundreds of factors influencing Earth’s climate, and that carbon dioxide “is one of these factors that gets essentially drowned out, and you can’t distinguish its effect from natural variability.” That claim is entirely false, as elegantly illustrated in this graphic created by Bloomberg.Human-caused global warming now far outside the range of natural variability.In fact, we’re now warming global temperatures more than 20 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate changes.And of course, climate scientists have observed human fingerprints all over climate change, most recently in the atmosphere.It would be absurd to take Marc Morano’s word over the evidence published in peer-reviewed studies by climate scientists at Nasa and other scientific institutions around the world.Lately, Facebook has struggled mightily in trying to figure out how to combat the epidemic of fake news propagated via its platform.Mark Zuckerberg made headlines last week when he defended fake news from Holocaust deniers, saying he didn’t “think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong.” It’s virtually impossible to discern an individual’s intent, but if that person is spreading misinformation, intent is irrelevant.If Facebook wants to stop misinforming millions of its users, it needs to tackle the problem of fake news regardless of intent.So far, Facebook seems more concerned about the appearance of ‘bias’ than about making sure the content shared on its site is factually correct.Fortunately, the exposure to Morano’s misinformation video is not as bad as it seems at first blush.Although Facebook implies the video has been viewed over 5m times, a “view” is counted after just three seconds, and videos on the site play automatically.Nevertheless, the video has been shared over 75,000 times, so it has certainly reached a wide audience.Facebook needs to come to terms with the fact that there is an objective reality.Even if Marc Morano sincerely believes humans aren’t causing global warming, that belief is false, and by continuing to host his myth-filled video, Facebook is misinforming tens of thousands, perhaps even millions of its users."

Adam Vaughan Wed 1 Aug 2012 16.58 BST First published on Wed 1 Aug 2012 16.58 BST Facebook has, for the first time, revealed the carbon footprint of its operations and its more than 900m users' likes, photo albums and status updates.The data, published on Wednesday, shows that despite the social networking's rising star, its carbon emissions are still a fraction of internet rival Google.Facebook's annual emissions were 285,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2011, compared with Google's 1.5m tons in 2010.The vast majority of the emissions (72%) come from the company's data centres in the US.The annual footprint for each user that's active monthly is 269 grams, or around the equivalent footprint of a cup of coffee, the company calculated.Facebook also detailed the mix of energy sources that power its data centres.The majority, 27%, comes from coal power, with the rest coming from renewable sources (23%), gas (17%), nuclear (13%) and the remaining 20% uncategorised.Greenpeace welcomed the move's transparency and hailed it as an important benchmark.Gary Cook, Greenpeace International's senior IT analyst, said: ""Facebook has committed to being fully renewably powered, and today's detailed disclosure and announcement of a clean energy target shows that the company means business and wants the world to follow its progress.""In October 2011, Facebook announced it would build a ""green"" data centre in Sweden, taking advantage of the country's cold climate to keep servers cool – one of the most energy intensive elements of data centre operations.As computing has moved from local machines to ""the cloud"", the real world environmental impact of hosting so much data has come under increasing scrutiny from green campaigners.Apple earlier this year disclosed the energy use of its data centre in North Carolina that powers its iCloud service."
https://www.facebook.com/notes/sustainability-at-facebook/sharing-our-footprint/666796753335584/,"Today we are sharing Facebook’s 2012 carbon footprint, energy mix, and energy use for our data centers and global offices, a follow-up to the release of our 2011 data last summer.Tracking and sharing this kind of data – whether annually or in real-time, as we started doing with power and water efficiency metrics for our data centers – continues to be an important part of how we hold ourselves accountable for the efficiency of our operations and our environmental impact, and how we uncover opportunities to improve both.More than 1 billion people around the world are now using Facebook, with more people joining the service daily.And as the number of people using Facebook continues to grow, so does our infrastructure.Our challenge is to figure out how to bring Facebook to everyone while limiting our impact on the natural environment as much as possible.From Open Compute servers to outside-air cooling systems to innovative building designs, our data centers are pushing the boundaries of efficiency and sustainability.We continue to take steps to increase the amount of renewable energy in our mix – through potential investments; data center siting decisions like Luleå, Sweden, with its access to hydropower and Altoona, Iowa, with its access to wind power; and collaboration with our utilities to make renewable energy more available to their customers.Our long-term focus on efficiency, smart design, and energy sources means that over time we expect our emissions growth to slow, our energy mix to get cleaner, and our carbon intensity to decrease.In the near-term, as expected, our energy use and overall greenhouse gas emissions continue to tick up.Here are the specifics:From 2011 to 2012, Facebook’s per-user carbon footprint changed only slightly, from .000249 metric tonnes of CO2e – or 249 grams – per monthly active user in 2011 to .000294 MT of CO2e – or 294 grams – in 2012.Put another way, one person’s Facebook use for all of 2012 had the same carbon impact as about three bananas, just as it did in 2011.Or a few glasses of wine.Or a latte.In 2012, Facebook’s total energy use from office space, data centers, and other facilities was approximately 704 million kWh.Greenhouse gas emissions from data centers, office space, employee commuting and air travel, data center construction, and hardware transportation totaled approximately 384,000 metric tonnes of CO2e in 2012.Since we released our energy use and carbon footprint data last year, we have found better, more precise ways to calculate some aspects of our environmental performance, including our data center Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from purchased electricity.We believe this increased precision helps us make a more direct connection between our energy sources and our environmental impact.Specifically, we have started calculating our data center carbon footprint using emissions factors from the utilities and energy projects that power our data centers (a “contractual” method) rather than relying on the commonly used location-based eGRID averages provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the International Energy Agency.The chart below illustrates what our carbon footprint looks like for 2011 and 2012 using both methods.As you dig into the specifics, you can see why we think the contractual method better reflects our actual operations, even if it sometimes paints a worse picture.For example, the 2012 carbon emissions from our Prineville, Oregon, data center are almost twice as high when you calculate them using a utility-specific emissions factor, as compared with the eGRID location-based average.On the other hand, using the location-based averages, our Lulea, Sweden, data center’s 2012 carbon emissions measured 158 metric tonnes.But the contractual emissions for our Lulea data center are actually zero, since it is being powered by hydroelectricity, which is cleaner than the local grid.While the GHG protocol is the standard for calculating greenhouse gas emissions, there is no consensus about which emissions factors to use when calculating carbon emissions from purchased electricity.There is an active debate under way about which method is best and we encourage anyone who is interested to add voice to the discussion.In 2012 our energy mix was 19% clean and renewable, 34% coal, 15% natural gas, 22% nuclear, and 10% uncategorized (power bought on the spot market).The percentage of clean and renewable energy in our mix declined from 2011 as we expected it would in the near term.As our Lulea, Sweden, data center – which is powered entirely by clean hydroelectric power – starts serving more traffic, the percentage of clean energy powering our data center operations will steadily rise.We continue to strive for 25% of our energy coming from clean and renewable sources by 2015 and are working hard to achieve this goal.If you’re interested in learning more about Facebook’s approach to efficiency, energy, and sustainability, check out these resources:"
https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/03/carbon-footprintgoogle-facebook/,"There’s a lot being done nowadays to reverse the effects of carbon emissions.It’s still not enough, but industries across the world are taking proactive measures to help reduce their negative impact on the environment.In construction, some buildings are now carbon neutral, meaning that the building has no net release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.We’re encouraged to buy locally sourced food products to cut down on carb emissions resulting from transportation of food.And we’ve definitely all come across the question, “Do you really need to print this email?” Get the entire 10-part series on Timeless Reading in PDF.Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues.See 2017 Hedge Fund Letters.It’s not just the physical things that cause carbon emissions however.We’re so used to our ever expanding digital lives being played out through a screen, that we don’t really think much about how this affects the environment.There is a price to pay though for our internet usage.For every tweet, comment, email and google search, a small amount of CO2 is emitted.It may not be a huge amount for one single person, but when you count up how many emails are being sent each day and how many social media users exist around the world, that amount suddenly becomes very big.It’s estimated that by 2021, there will be 3.02 billion users of social media.That’s 41% of the world’s population.Facebook say that each of their users emits 299g of CO2 per year.Not bad.But for 3.02 billions users?It adds up and the number of users is expected to grow beyond 3.02 billion at 2021.With more and more of our lives happening digitally, from shopping online for goods and services, to our jobs, banking and daily communication, we’re relying on technology to keep our world turning.Thanks to the colossal number of data centres that are now needed to feed planet earth’s internet obsession, the online world is now beginning to damage the real world.Credit Brokers Credit Angel looked into the carbon footprint of the internet and found out some shocking statistics.If you think the internet can’t possibly be producing that much CO2, think again.Let’s start with the world’s data centres.They’re stuffed from top to bottom with servers.Those servers are filled with web pages, apps, downloadable files and databases that we’re all so familiar with on a day to day basis.All this data runs on a lot of electricity, not just for powering the machines, but for providing air conditioning to keep the machines from overheating.That’s just the beginning.PC’s and monitors are power hungry.When you total it all up, you can say that the internet burns around as much fossil fuel as is burned in Turkey or Poland in one year.For a closer look at the carbon footprint of the internet, check out this infographic from Credit Angel.YouTube Facebook Google Twitter Emails Subscribe to ValueWalk Newsletter.We respect your privacy no spam ever We won't send you spam.Unsubscribe at any time."

Facebook data centre in Clonee has been considered, even a plan for saving the bees.Facebook’s new €300m data centre park in Clonee, Co Meath, is powered 100pc by renewable energy and boasts the most advanced and energy-efficient data centres in the world, the company said.It worked with Brookfield Renewables to tap into its wind energy assets in Ireland to not only power the three data centres on the site but also its international headquarters in Dublin.The social network employs 3,000 people in Ireland.Facebook last month revealed it is one of the most active purchasers of renewable energy in the world today and by 2020, it aims to be supported 100pc by clean and renewable energy.Since its first wind contract in 2013, Facebook said it has contracted more than three gigawatts of solar and wind energy.From left: Mark Hunter, data centre site manager, Facebook, with Niall McEntegart, data centre operations director of EMEA, Facebook.Image: Robbie Reynolds Facebook broke ground on the Clonee data centre in 2016 and, during construction, averaged 1,150 people on site per day, peaking at 1,550 per day.This has made it one of the largest construction projects in Ireland for prolonged periods, with 7.2m hours of construction logged.Facebook has now completed the first two data centre buildings in Clonee and commenced building on the third phase last October.In December, it started serving Facebook applications and services to people all over the world from Clonee.The total site area is 250 acres, equal to about four Dublin Zoos, and each of the three data centres on the site is 377 metres in length.58,000 cubic metres of concrete were used, enough to fill 23.6 Olympic swimming pools, while 11,800 tonnes of primary structural steel were used, enough to construct nearly two Eiffel Towers.In keeping with the environmental theme, the data centre park is accredited as a supporter of the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan.Bees from the facility fly up to 5km from its apiary to benefit local gardens as well as farmer crop yields by up to 30pc due to increased pollination.“A third of Ireland’s bee species are threatened with extinction because we have drastically reduced the amount of food (flowers) and safe nesting sites in our landscapes,” Facebook stated.“To offset this, we have added a wider variety of native plants, shrubs and trees on site to provide food for the bees.” As part of its community outreach – which has seen Facebook invest €2.5m in local projects in regions where it has facilities – the social network is inviting grant applications for projects in Meath aimed at strengthening the local community.These are projects that address community needs by putting the power of technology to use for community benefit, connecting people online or off, improving local STEM education, or are related to either technology or culture.Examples include investments in tablet computers for local schools and supporting local makerspaces to interest young people in STEM.Prominent projects elsewhere include putting VR stations at a public library in Altoona in Iowa and an initiative to improve literacy levels in Texas.Further information on the Community Action Grants Programme can be found on the Clonee data centre Facebook page.Related: Renewables, Facebook, energy, data centres John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist who

Published on July 20th, 2018 | by Joshua S Hill July 20th, 2018 by Joshua S Hill Facebook and electricity company Pacific Power announced a partnership this week to build 437 megawatts (MW) worth of new solar projects in Oregon to power Facebook’s Prineville Data Center with 100% renewable energy.Officials from Pacific Power, Facebook, Crook County and the City of Prineville, and Governor Kate Brown.Officials from Facebook and Pacific Power joined with those from Crook County, the City of Prineville, and Oregon Governor Kate Brown on Wednesday to announce that Facebook’s Prineville Data Center will soon be powered by 100% renewable energy from new solar projects set to be developed between Pacific Power and Facebook.Specifically, the two will develop 437 MW worth of new solar, including two projects totaling 100 MW in the Prineville area.The move serves to cement Prineville’s growing data center industry while demonstrating the value of using renewable energy to power data centers — value which not only provides clean energy to energy-intensive operations but fuels local economic growth and benefits as well as contributing to Facebook’s long-term sustainability and renewable energy goals.“At Pacific Power, we believe in the power of partnership,” said Stefan Bird, president and CEO of Pacific Power.“As a 100-year company with a long history of serving smaller communities across Oregon, we believe progress is best achieved when business and community come together.We view this partnership as a way for Facebook to meet its sustainability goals and for Prineville and its neighboring Central Oregon communities to grow and thrive, while delivering cost-effective resources to all of our customers.” “Our work with Pacific Power to develop new solar resources represents a significant milestone for our hyper-efficient Prineville Data Center,” added Peter Freed, Facebook’s energy strategy manager.“We are committed to supporting 100% renewable energy, and we are thrilled to have found a solution for our first data center.We are proud to be a part of the Prineville community, and look forward to a continued partnership with the city and the state of Oregon.” Facebook first opened the digital doors to its Prineville data center in 2011, and since then the economic returns on its presence in the area has led to decreased unemployment (17% down to 6.5%) and stronger infrastructure development, including new roads, parks, and even an elementary school — the last of which has been supported with education grants, upgrades to school curriculum, and more STEM education opportunities.“We are expanding from our timber roots to a future with greater business diversity and a workforce with broader skills,” said Prineville Mayor Betty Jean Roppe.“It is through contributions and support from organizations like Facebook and Pacific Power, that Prineville is growing new jobs and strengthening our schools with programs that meet the skills needs of tomorrow.This inspires new paths and opportunities for future generations, right here in town.” I reached out to Facebook to understand how this recent announcements fits into their overall sustainability plan, but as of publishing had not heard back.I will update as appropriate.var advertiser_id = 4; (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Tags: Facebook, Facebook Prineville Data Center, Pacific Power, Prineville Data Center, Prineville Data Centre Joshua S Hill I'm a Christian, a nerd, a geek, and I believe that we're pretty quickly directing planet-Earth into hell in a handbasket!I also write for Fantasy Book Review (.co.uk), and can be found writing articles for a variety of other sites.Check me out at about.me for more.Advertise with CleanTechnica to get your company in front of millions of monthly readers.Follow @cleantechnica

solar power Cuomo's 'renewable' fiasco Solar plant opened in Gaza Strip to further Palestinians' energy independence Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway duped by 'Ponzi-type' scheme De Blasio’s double standard on fighting climate change The Prospero Solar project just north of Odessa, Texas, will have a capacity of 379 megawatts, which is enough to power around 72,000 homes based on the national average, the Solar Energy Industries Association said.The project goes beyond Facebook’s goal to use renewable energy to power its data centers, where the social media giant stores photos, videos and other information that people post on the platform.Prospero Solar is expected to be completed next year and will take up around 7 square miles — more than five times the size of Central Park in New York City.Menlo Park, California-based Facebook will be the sole tax equity investor, Longroad said.Ben Inskeep, a research analyst for EQ Research, a North Carolina-based renewable energy consulting firm, said it makes sense for Facebook to invest in solar power because renewable energy is becoming more affordable and its data centers have huge operating costs.“West Texas has some of the best solar resources in the nation,” Inskeep said.“So it’s not about saying you support renewable energy.It makes good business sense.” Shell Energy North America and Facebook will share the power generated by the solar farm.“Facebook is excited to be one of the first companies to use a direct investment to meet our renewable energy goals,” company energy strategy manager Peter Freed said in a statement.CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in April that Facebook was building six new solar projects to support its data centers.They house tens of thousands of computer servers, which are linked to the outside world through fiber-optic cables.“Our data centers are already some of the most energy efficient in the world and last year we set a goal for all our data centers and offices to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2020,” Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page.“These new solar projects will help us reach that goal.” It comes as Facebook battles New Mexico regulators over a new transmission line to its data center in the small town of Los Lunas.State regulators last month declined to reconsider their decision for the largest utility to bill Facebook $39 million for the transmission line.They said ratepayers could not be charged for the project because the line wouldn’t benefit retail customers.The Public Service Co. of New Mexico said it’s disappointed by the decision and is reviewing options for how to proceed.The New Mexico data center is one of seven such sites for Facebook and includes six buildings for data storage.It is situated on a patch of desert at the edge of Los Lunas, which lies just beyond the edge of New Mexico’s largest metropolitan area and along the Rio Grande.Each of the data center’s buildings is roughly the size of four football fields and has several “data halls,” or darkened, vast rooms where Facebook plans to store dozens of rows of towering servers.Two of those halls are now in operation, while construction that began more than two years ago will continue until 2023, the company said.Read Next ‘Homework gap’ shows millions of students lack home in...

Published on August 30th, 2018 | by Joshua S Hill August 30th, 2018 by Joshua S Hill Facebook announced that it was upping the environmental ante on Tuesday by committing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 75% and power its global operations with 100% renewable energy by the end of 2020.It’s already been a big year for Facebook’s sustainability efforts, with the company signing several Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) to increase its total purchased renewable energy to over 3 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind energy — including over 2.5 GW over the past 12 months.In March Facebook and Adobe signed PPAs for the electricity generated from the soon-to-be-completed 320 megawatts (MW) Rattlesnake Creek wind farm in Nebraska.In May, the company signed a 294 MW PPA with asset manager Luxcara and Swedish power company Vattenfall to secure the electricity generated from three wind farms located in southwest Norway to power the company’s Nordic data centers.And in July, Facebook partnered with electric company Pacific Power to build 437 MW worth of new solar projects in Oregon that will power the company’s Prineville Data Center with 100% renewable energy.Earlier this month, Bloomberg New Energy Finance published new figures which showed that not only was Facebook leading the way in terms of corporate procurement — securing 1.1 GW worth of clean energy PPAs already this year — but that corporate procurement for the first half of 2018 had already surpassed procurement levels for the whole of 2017.All of this has helped Facebook surpass its already ambitious targets.In 2015, the company set a goal of powering 50% of its facilities with renewable energy by 2018 — a goal it accomplished a year earlier than planned It comes as little surprise, then, that Facebook is able to make such a ground-breaking commitment as transitioning to be powered entirely by renewable energy by 2020.Further, and importantly, each of the renewable energy projects Facebook is involved with are new and connected to the same grid as its data centers, which means that Facebook is investing directly into the communities around it, providing jobs and investment and a healthier environment.Instead of relying on renewable energy investments coupled with green energy certificates, Facebook has committed to supporting renewable energy development in ways that will best support local communities.“Due to the growing number of people joining the Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp community and the use of new features like video and stories, we have had to grow our data center presence with six data centers announced in just the last 12 months,” said Bobby Hollis, Facebook’s Head of Global Energy.“This growth, and our strong commitment to renewable energy, has driven our strategy and procurement.In addition, we also worked hard with our key partners to enable renewable energy for our original data centers.“We hope to lead by example and show how renewable energy is not only good for the world and for communities, but it also makes good business sense.We are not only committed to supporting all of our operations with 100% renewable energy, but to growing and improving access to the market.We have done this by encouraging our partners and community stakeholders to foster renewable market development and by working with utilities to develop green tariffs that allow companies like us to buy new renewable resources.” “CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reaffirmed Facebook’s place among business leaders in the race to be coal-free and 100% renewable-powered,” said Greenpeace Senior Corporate Campaigner Gary Cook.“If we are to stay within the 1.5 degree threshold that scientists say is crucial to avoid catastrophic climate change, we need many more companies stepping up to adopt aggressive renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals.” “Facebook has shown just what companies can achieve when they show ambition and leadership in tackling climate change,” added Cook.“Samsung Electronics, one of the most recent companies to adopt 100% renewable commitments, would be well-served to follow Facebook’s example.” var advertiser_id = 4; (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Tags: 100% renewable energy, corporate procurement, Facebook, PPA, PPAs Joshua S Hill I'm a Christian, a nerd, a geek, and I believe that we're pretty quickly directing planet-Earth into hell in a handbasket!I also write for Fantasy Book Review (.co.uk), and can be found writing articles for a variety of other sites.Check me out at about.me for more.Advertise with CleanTechnica to get your company in front of millions of monthly readers.Follow @cleantechnica

IBM SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 11, 2019, /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) researchers have created a new technology called VolCat, a catalytic chemical process that can turn PET, a type of plastic commonly used in food packaging and polyester clothing, into a renewable resource.The cost-effective and sustainable innovation is capable of breathing new life into old plastic.Currently, more than 272 million metric tons of plastic is produced each year around the globe, with one-quarter of that made up of PET.VolCat aims to use a precise combination of chemicals, heat and pressure to reduce this amount of plastic, and ultimately the amount of waste, produced.This could completely transform the way we discard and manufacture plastic in the next five years.To learn more about this new technology and IBM's full list of 5 in 5 predictions, visit the IBM Research blog and tune into a live presentation from the IBM Think conference on Wednesday, February 13 at 10 a.m. PT.IBM Media Relations Contact: Jeannie Entin IBM Research Communications

Search In October 2018, IBM established a second-generation renewable electricity procurement goal: source 55 percent of the electricity IBM consumes globally from renewable supplies by 2025.The amount includes both directly contracted and grid supplied renewable electricity.We are working with IBM's energy providers to increase our procurement of renewable electricity to support our operations.We are also collaborating with a range of entities -- companies, utilities, energy retailers, and nongovernmental organizations -- to increase the portion of renewable electricity incorporated into the reliable grid electricity supply we depend on to run IBM operations.IBM does not plan to use unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to achieve our goals.Unbundled RECs are an accounting mechanism used by other companies to claim GHG emissions reductions even though the renewable energy was generated in a different grid region than where these companies are using energy.Said another way, the companies do not physically consume those renewables but take credit for having helped fund renewable energy projects.At IBM, we believe that the use of unbundled RECs sends the wrong market signals and obfuscates the need for public policy and investments required to genuinely increase the amount of renewables in the grid and ensure reliable power delivery.In 2017, IBM contracted with its utility suppliers to purchase approximately 779,000 MWh of renewable electricity, representing 22.9 percent of our global electricity consumption by IBM-managed locations.These purchases exceeded IBM's goal to purchase 20 percent of its electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020, over and above the quantity of renewable electricity provided as part of the mix of electricity that we purchase from the grid.IBM avoided 275,000 MT of CO2 emissions through these purchases.We purchased contracted renewable electricity in 20 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.In March 2018, IBM finalized a power purchase agreement to acquire all of the electricity -- roughly 10,000 MWh per year -- generated by a 6-megawatt solar array to be constructed at IBM's Boulder, Colorado, facility.The array is expected to go into production by early 2019.We procure renewable electricity generated from wind, large and small hydro, biomass, and solar installations around the globe.We report all of our contracted renewable electricity purchases -- whether from new or existing generation sources, ""additional"" or otherwise, without discriminating against large hydro installations -- and their associated CO2 avoidance.Our rationale is that all purchases signal to suppliers our desire for them to maintain and broaden their renewable electricity offerings.We value all economically accessible renewable generation sources and their availability from our utility suppliers.Combining our contracted renewable electricity purchases and the amount of renewable electricity IBM received as part of the grid mix, 41.4 percent of our global electricity supply for IBM-managed locations was generated from renewable sources in 2017.The percentages of the electricity we consumed, both contracted and grid-supplied purchases that came from renewable sources were: Europe 67 percent, Latin America 63 percent, North America 28 percent, and Asia Pacific 18 percent.For additional information, see:"

https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/03/ibm-climate-change/," March 9, 2018 | Written by: Lloyd Treinish Categorized: Environment Share this post: As a long-time IBMer and environmental scientist, I’ve been fortunate to work on many efforts that not only help our clients but can help the world.This follows a long tradition at the core of IBM about doing good for our environment, which began as a Corporate policy in 1971.This commitment has extended to issues around our changing climate, including setting and meeting three greenhouse gas emission reduction goals between 1990 and 2016.Because of this leadership, IBM has received several environmental awards, including one earlier this month.In an era when the importance of acknowledging that our climate is changing is often challenged, we should recall IBM’s enduring commitment: why IBM stands firm in supporting the Paris Climate Agreement and why we lead in the fight against climate change.“Connecting to this stance, IBM issued a call for proposals last summer for climate research that can leverage our IBM World Community Grid for crowdsourced computing power, cloud-based storage, and data from The Weather Company.The response to this call was overwhelming.We heard from over 70 research groups interested in these resources to support their work to understand climate change.We are now finalizing the evaluation of the proposals to determine which research will be supported.You can contribute to the effort by registering your devices to be part of the World Community Grid.We will be talking about this activity at the upcoming SXSW conference in a panel called, “Saving the Planet: What’s Tech Got to Do With It?” We have long-standing work from IBM Research and The Weather Company related to a critical environmental science, namely meteorology.More recent efforts initiated out of IBM Research with a focus on environmental stewardship and sustainability include The Jefferson Project at Lake George (see also the Darrin Fresh Water Institute and Jefferson Project at Lake George as well as this paper, Inner Workings: Smart-sensor network keeps close eye on lake ecosystem), the Vermont Weather Analytics Center and Green Horizon.You can read more about these and other efforts in IBM here and here.Although much of my own work at IBM has focused on improving weather forecasts for business applications, I worked on climate problems at NASA in the 1980s.Today, our team at IBM Research is now looking at some of the scientific challenges associated with planning for the impact of climate change.Like weather, many of our clients need an understanding of what will likely happen to mitigate such impacts.Unlike weather, many of the decisions associated with climate are of a strategic not tactical nature, such as determining how and what changes in infrastructure may be required that take years to build and have a lifetime of decades.As an example, consider our recent paper, Impacts of projected urban expansion and global warming on cooling energy demand over a semiarid region.While the science has continued to evolve, the core concerning the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases on the climate has long been established.We saw evidence over three decades ago when I was at NASA.The difference today is a significant reduction in the uncertainty and increase in precision, and a far greater understanding of the impacts.So, let’s be clear about the facts.Global atmospheric carbon dioxide has passed 400 parts per million.That level last occurred over three million years ago, when both the average temperature and sea level were much higher than today.Yes, the global annually averaged surface air temperature has increased by about 1°C since 1900.That means that the last century is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization.This increase could reach 5°C by the end of this century.We are at a tipping point.Despite slowing growth in carbon emissions, we will likely exceed 2°C of warming within two decades.Yes, the global average sea level has risen by about seven to eight inches since 1900.However, this rise has been accelerating – three inches in the last 25 years.It could be feet later in this century.But it is far more than polar bears stranded on melting ice.The oceans are not just rising.They are warming, and becoming more acidic with lower levels of oxygen.That will have a negative impact on life in our oceans, which will impact the global food chain.Let’s be clear about the facts.Global atmospheric carbon dioxide has passed 400 parts per million.Temperature and precipitation extremes are becoming more common.That has led many to think that the impacts are only related to increased risk from severe storms.For example, there were 16 weather-related events in the US in 2017, each of which had over $1B of impact, for a total of $306.2B.This is nicely summarized in the map below as provided by NOAA.But how many and what kind of these events can be attributed to a changing climate?We can begin to answer these questions.The U.S. wildfire season is three months longer than in 1940 and more intense.Tropical storms of greater intensity are being observed.There are more flooding events due to precipitation of greater intensity and coastal storm surge.Of course, there are also increased droughts, some of which are at a crisis stage like in South Africa or Iran.There are aspects of such events, which cannot yet be attributed to a changing climate.They include more or stronger tornadoes, hail and severe thunderstorms as well as more frequent tropical storms.One reason is the reliable, detailed historical records only go back a couple of decades.We expect that this picture will become clearer in the near future.But there are also some known unknowns.For example, what happens when there is less polar ice?The variability in temperatures that have been observed in North America and Europe this winter, may be examples of that.Methane is roughly 60 times more efficient as a greenhouse gas compared to carbon dioxide, although it is not as long-lived in the atmosphere.A large and unknown amount of methane is trapped in the permafrost within the tundra regions of the northern hemisphere.As these areas warm and the permafrost melts, how much methane will be released and how will that accelerate the current warming?I will follow up with another blog to talk about the societal and economic impact of these changes to our climate.You can become more informed and help others to learn more.There is a wealth of material such as on-line courses like Communicating Climate Change Scenarios, or from sources like The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the year-long digital series from The Weather Company, United States of Climate Change, investigating the impact of climate change across America, and how this has affected lives in each of the 50 states.IBM Distinguished Engineer climate global

https://newatlas.com/ibm-solar-collector-reaches-80-percent-efficiency/27256/,"Jonathan Fincher 15 pictures IBM is developing an affordable High Concentration PhotoVoltaic Thermal (HCPVT) system that uses cooling technology from supercomputers to harvest solar energy and produce drinkable water Solar power may provide a clean, abundant source of energy, but we know the sun's rays are capable of much, much more.Aside from generating electricity, we've seen solar energy harnessed to produce drinkable water as well, so why not combine the two processes into one system?That's what IBM and its collaborators are hoping to do with an affordable High Concentration Photovoltaic Thermal (HCPVT) system that uses cooling technology from supercomputers to harvest solar energy more efficiently, and produce purified water at the same time.The current prototype consists of a large parabolic dish made up of several mirrors, connected to a sun-tracking system.The majority of the sunlight hitting the dish is reflected and focused onto hundreds of triple-junction photovoltaic chips, all fitted to microchannel-liquid cooled receivers.Individually, each chip measures just 1 cm x 1 cm and can generates an average of 200–250 watts over an eight-hour period on a sunny day, at an efficiency of about 30 percent.Thus far, this roughly matches the electrical power output and basic design of other concentrated solar systems in existence, but the cooling system is what really makes the HCPVT system stand apart.IBM adapted the cooling technology it developed for supercomputers like Aquasar and SuperMUC for use with photovoltaics to create a system that continually pumps water just a few micrometers away from each chip through micro-structured layers.IBM says this method is 10 times more effective than using air-cooling, and maintains a stable temperature over the chips to prevent them from melting.The cooling system would allow the chips to remain operational at 2,000 times the intensity of the sun's rays, but IBM claims it can still provide a safe temperature up to 5,000 times concentration.In those IBM's supercomputers, the heat absorbed by the liquid coolant has been used to heat the physical buildings sheltering the system itself, but the HCPVT system developers have a different idea.Instead, the heated waste water could be diverted to a desalination system, where it vaporizes and purifies salt water.The researchers estimate this could produce 30-40 liters of clean water per square meter of the receiver area in a day.Alternatively, the scientists would like to direct the heated water to an adsorption chiller, which could produce air conditioning for a nearby area.By combining electrical and thermal collection units into a single setup, the research team predicts the HCPVT system would be able to convert 80 percent of the captured solar energy into a usable form.Another advantage to the HCPVT system is that it would cost considerably less than comparable solar energy systems, while still running more efficiently.Much of the system would be comprised of lightweight concrete and metal foils, as opposed to most other solar collectors that are constructed out of pricier glass and steel, leaving only the small, high-tech components to be produced in Switzerland.This also has the added benefits of lowering the costs for assembly and maintenance, which could potentially expand the number of regions that could implement it.The research team claims this design would cost less than US$250 for each square meter of aperture area and produce energy at a price of under US$0.10 per kilowatt-hour (kWh).According to IBM, this puts the system on par or lower with energy costs for coal power stations.Currently, the prototype HCPVT system is being tested at an IBM research lab in Zurich, with additional prototypes planned for Biasca and Rüschlikon, Switzerland in the future.The researchers also hope to begin constructing larger versions of the system in remote locations at some point, but we'll have to see if they can also build the necessary infrastructure needed for such an undertaking.Scientists at IBM Research, Airlight Energy, ETH Zurich, and Interstate University of Applied Sciences Buchs NTB began collaborating on the project after receiving a three-year grant for US$2.4 million from the Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation.IBM Research's manager of advanced thermal packaging, Bruno Michel, explains the HPVCT system further in the video below.Source: IBM The current prototype consists of a large

Search IBM's strategy is to procure renewable electricity that is generated in the grid regions where IBM's facilities are located.When possible, we match our purchases to the physical consumption of our facilities so that we are consuming the electricity at the same time that the renewable electricity is being generated.However, output from wind and solar facilities varies depending on the time of day and the weather conditions.As such, we must rely on electricity generated from conventional sources (i.e., fossil fuels) to ensure business continuity.When our consumption exceeds the output from renewable sources, we may use ""bundled"" Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to offset the CO2 emissions associated with the electricity we consume from conventional sources.Our intent is to procure renewable electricity and its zero-emissions attributes from the grid regions in which our facilities operate, either by directly matching our physical consumption or using bundled RECs to offset emissions.We do not use ""unbundled"" RECs, supplied from renewable generation projects in grid regions outside of our energy consuming locations, to offset the emissions from our use of conventionally generated electricity.The reason is simple: IBM would not actually be using the renewable electricity that the purchase of unbundled RECs helped to fund.It also obfuscates the need for hard public policy decisions and investments across the energy value chain that must be made to genuinely increase the quantity and availability of renewable electricity delivered to the grid.We would certainly like to be able to power our operations with 100 percent renewable electricity, and we are committed to expanding our procurement of renewable electricity for our global operations.However, we recognize that it is not possible in today's market or in the foreseeable future to actually power IBM's operations reliably with 100 percent renewable electricity, given the company's vast and diverse presence in over 170 countries along with the need for uninterrupted power usually made possible by fossil fuels.Our strategy and approach make it clear to our electricity suppliers that we want them to increase the quantity and availability of renewable electricity in their offerings.IBM continues to work with industry peers, utilities, NGOs and other renewable energy industry participants to develop new contracting methods and to identify and capture new opportunities to procure electricity generated from renewable sources.In 2017, we were active in the World Resources Institute's Special Clean Power Council.The Council, comprised of leading U.S. electric utilities and several of their major commercial and industrial customers, began engaging in a two-year effort to facilitate the transition to low-carbon energy supply and enabling technologies to reduce the GHG emissions associated with power generation.We are also members of the Business Renewables Center and the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, groups committed to broadening and expanding the availability of renewable electricity to corporate buyers."
https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/12/how-technology-is-shaping-the-renewable-energy-sector/," December 5, 2017 | Written by: Renata Mattos Categorized: Blockchain Developers | Blockchain Education | Blockchain Explained Share this post: According to the World Economic Forum, in 2016 solar and wind energy became cheaper than fossil fuels, indicating that the battle against global warming could become a lucrative business.The same article indicates that by late 2016, 47 developing countries had updated their energy plans by raising their reusable energy consumption targets to 100 percent.At the same time, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma and others invested $1 billion USD in Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a fund for emerging energy source research.The World Economic Forum article points out that many new investments in energy infrastructure today go to renewable energy.The biggest investments come from Asia, where India and China have submitted huge projects in solar energy, which became the cheapest renewable energy last year, well ahead of the original forecast.The article also says that most multinational companies have 100 percent green energy adoption targets for their operations.Substituting the transportation systems in big cities, which used to consume about 50 percent of the total production of fossil fuels, with electrical, intelligent, clean systems can also lead to a drastic decrease in the demand of fossil fuels.What’s your potential blockchain ROI?I see several possibilities for how technology could change the energy distribution game in the near future.These include new batteries or generators capable of storing energy surplus, blockchain technology, and intelligent meters (the Internet of Things, or IoT) connected to intelligent grids and distribution networks.For years, the energy industry has put research into long-lasting batteries that store surplus energy efficiently and in a viable, economical way.These possibilities could elevate consumers into the role of producers and eventually to “suppliers” in the existing energy distribution network.Blockchain technology uses decentralized data storage to record digital transactions.Instead of having a central administrator, such as a traditional database (controlled by banks, governments, accountants, registries), blockchain has a network of replicated databases, synchronized over the internet and visible to anyone on the web.The use of intelligent meters (IoT) as nodes for energy consumers and producers makes it possible to track consumption and payments.Smart contracts can initiate the transfer of funds between accounts based on usage data received from each of these meters, ensuring accuracy.Blockchain is intertwined with all of this, documenting the transactions and creating a reliable network of energy tracking.Institutions such as the American LO3 TransActive Grid and the Australian Power Ledger understand the business potential these technologies may represent in the near future.These institutions present solutions for the commercialization of surplus energy produced by any consumer, whether a residence, a condominium, a factory or a farm.Solutions typically allow each unit of electricity to be traced from the point of generation to the point of consumption using the local electricity distribution network.Blockchain combines a tracked energy transaction with a financial transaction, making the process simpler and safer.In Europe, TenneT, a leading electricity transmission system operator, is concerned about the limitations of conventional energy sources and decided to invest in new ways to produce and supply energy to be ready for the future increase in demand.TenneT joined forces with sonnen, in Germany, and Vandebron, in the Netherlands, to explore a permissioned blockchain network using The Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric to integrate flexible capacity supplied by electric cars and household batteries into the electrical grid.Vandebron is a known 100 percent renewable energy supplier in the Netherlands that has acquired expertise in electric transportation.In the partnership with TenneT, Vandebron clients will make their electric car batteries capacity available to TenneT to balance its grid, without compromising the availability of their car batteries.Blockchain enables each car to participate by recording their availability and their action in response to signals from TenneT.The sonnen Group is one of the fastest growing companies in Germany, and sonnen eService (the energy branch of sonnen group) already supplies over 60,000 people globally with clean energy.The sonnenCommunity is an online network based on the blockchain idea for sharing self-generated power.To help reduce the instability of wind energy distribution caused by insufficient transmission capacity, a network of residential solar batteries is been formed by sonnen eServices.Blockchain allows the operator from TenneT to view the available pool and activate the batteries according to the grid need.Blockchain also records batteries’ contribution and credit.Soon, coupling cognitive solutions with intelligent grids will enable consumers and energy distributors to work in partnership, predicting peak consumption and natural phenomena, and locating surplus energy without demand, thus avoiding blackouts and other incidents.Technology and innovation are helping to break the status quo of the energy industry and make producers and distributors, as well as consumers, review their role in the chain.And who knows, by changing behaviors maybe we can make renewable energy sources more sustainable.Curious about how to use the Blockchain?IBM Blockchain Developer Center may be a good way to explore and accelerate blockchain application development with free tools, tutorials and community collaboration.There you can also find a very

https://www.ibm.com/blogs/industries/alectra-utilities-is-powering-a-renewable-energy-breakthrough/,"IoT Blockchain Energy and Utilities By Rich McKay | 3 minute read | February 14, 2019 Photo by Karsten Würth (@inf1783) on Unsplash Vikram Singh figured his customers might respond positively to a new renewable energy pilot, but the unbridled enthusiasm he encountered when he introduced it to them caught him by surprise.“Customers were literally showing off our interface at dinner parties: the system, the battery, how they could see the amount of energy consumption go up in their house if they turned on a washing machine,” said Singh, the director of advanced planning at the Canada-based Alectra Utilities, the second-largest municipal utility in North America.“We’re just not used to that level of engagement from customers.” The pilot that ignited that passion is Power.House, an intelligent storage solar system for residential customers that includes rooftop PV panels and a lithium-ion battery installed behind the meter.The systems are autonomously controlled through software to simulate a larger power-generating facility.The pilot began with just 20 homes, but Singh said it could eventually expand to include up to 30,000 homes.In addition to protecting against outages, Singh believes Power.House will help customers save money on their energy bills by making them both producers and suppliers in a distributed energy resources network.By generating their own energy, he said, customers can send surplus power back to the grid for additional credit.These days, Singh said, customers want more choice and autonomy, and are “relying more on taking their energy generation and consumption into their own hands, especially with an increase in hazardous weather.” Curious how blockchain can help optimize your grid?But if thousands of residences, factories, farms, and businesses start producing and selling energy, things can get very complicated.To ensure the accurate and safe documentation of a growing number of energy transactions, forward-looking utilities like Alectra are beginning to look to an emerging digital technology: blockchain.“The energy services market is in an ideal position to benefit from blockchain technology,” said Singh.“It’s this value chain that has a bunch of intermediaries and complex exchanges of information across a completely distributed network of market participants.” In the Power.House pilot, blockchain technology provided by IBM allows each unit of electricity to be traced from the point of generation to the point of consumption using the local electricity distribution network.It combines a tracked energy transaction with a financial transaction, making the process simpler and safer.And it can remedy any challenges with an open, transparent, and timely exchange of energy for value.“Trust, visibility, and transparency are fundamental for the efficient functioning of the market,” Singh said.“It also allows us to integrate energy systems with secondary systems like financial services systems.” Blockchain’s arrival coincides with the shift of energy generation from large-scale power plants to a network of super-smart and super-clean energy sources.It also coincides with the rise of microgrids, which are smaller grid systems linked to localized power sources often called DERs.By 2021, experts estimate, off grid energy will reach cost and performance parity with grid-delivered energy.Under the right conditions, an Alectra release notes, the energy generated by this virtual power plant could “result in the potential to defer energy infrastructure investments by at least two years in the late 2020s.” “We will rely less on deploying hardware and capital in the field and move more toward a market-based approach for procuring energy services,” Singh said.At a time when smaller startups are nibbling at the bottom line of larger utilities, Singh said, companies like Alectra have the potential to lead the way in the renewable energy sector due to their incumbent “trust” advantage.“In a fractured renewable energy market, there are a lot of young startups that show up and then disappear,” Singh said.“Utilities are in a unique position to bring a lot of credibility to the renewable sector, especially as many customers still see it as a fringe concept.They’re seen as a trusted advisor and authority that is able to communicate to customers when other service providers or other technologies are equally trustworthy.” Utilities should be flexible when catering to the evolving needs of their customers—even if that means investing in distributed solutions over traditional infrastructure.The success of the Power.House pilot has provided that important lesson for Alectra’s CEO Brian Bentz.“As a utility, I should be as agnostic with a behind-the-meter, sustainable, customer-empowering solution as I am with poles and wires,” Bentz said.“In fact, I should probably favor the former more than the latter because it does empower consumers and it’s more sustainable, assuming economics are relatively close.” In the Power.House pilot, technology provided by IBM Blockchain allows each unit of electricity to be traced from the point of generation to the point of consumption using the local electricity distribution network.Curious how blockchain can help

https://www.ibm.com/blogs/citizen-ibm/2019/01/balta-next-gen-env-standards/," January 14, 2019 | Written by: Wayne Balta Categorized: Environment Share this post: IBM has a long history of taking action to reduce its environmental impacts and has delivered significant energy conservation results and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions for nearly three decades.Building upon the company’s early and sustained record in addressing climate change, we recently announced IBM’s fourth-generation GHG emissions reduction goal and a second-generation renewable electricity procurement goal.IBM’s new goals cover the energy consumption and corresponding carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with our company’s global operations – from research, product development and manufacturing activities to our enterprise and cloud data center operations.The goals include all of IBM’s activities whether they take place in real estate managed by IBM or by a third-party landlord.Specifically, our next generation goals state: Achieving our CO2 emissions reduction goal requires an annual reduction of 2.2 percent of IBM’s CO2 emissions from 2010 to 2025, exceeding the 2 percent reduction per year science-based benchmark recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 2014 5th Assessment Report.Our goal is also inline with IPCC’s recommendations in its 2018 Special Report, “Global Warming of 1.5°C,” calling for a 2.25 percent per year reduction in GHG emissions from 2010 to 2030 to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.We are working with IBM’s energy providers to increase our procurement and consumption of renewable electricity.We also are collaborating with peers in industry, energy providers, and nongovernmental organizations to increase the portion of renewable electricity incorporated into reliable grid electricity supplies.A sustainable renewable energy future requires not only the capacity to generate renewable energy but also better grid integration and an enhanced forecasting and demand management system.Importantly, IBM does not plan to use unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) as a means of asserting that IBM is using renewable energy.In the case of unbundled RECs, an electricity provider generates renewable electricity and then creates a certificate (i.e., a REC) which represents that renewable electricity.Furthermore, the provider separates or “unbundles” the certificate from the renewable electricity with which it is affiliated so it can sell the electricity and the certificate separately from each other.The electricity is sold into the grid region in which it is generated, but the “unbundled” REC is often sold to an entity which is not actually consuming that renewable electricity.Instead, that entity may be a consumer of conventional electricity (i.e., fossil fuels) in other grid regions which purchases unbundled RECs to offset the emissions from its ongoing consumption of fossil fuels.There is no physical connection between the facility generating the renewable electricity and the entity purchasing an unbundled REC.Stated another way, purchasing unbundled RECs does not equate to consuming the renewable electricity with which they’re affiliated.We have set our goals with a clear focus on matching, as much as feasible, our purchases of renewable electricity with our actual consumption of renewable electricity.We will also continue to transparently communicate our goals and performance.Our next generation goals are aggressive and are consistent with IBM’s commitment to environmental leadership.We will continue to innovate, conserve energy, procure renewable electricity, and reduce GHG emissions.Wayne Balta is Vice President for

https://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-ibm-obsesses-over-energy-efficiency,"If you think your organization has done all it can to cut back its power consumption, think again.IBM has had a formal energy conservation program in place for almost 45 years, and it’s still finding many ways annually to squeeze its electricity usage.During 2017 alone, the $36.5 billion cloud computing and technology services company completed more than 2,000 projects to that end — everything from installing systems that match building lighting and heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) loads to occupancy schedules to completely a new wave of data center efficiency upgrades.Those projects were spread across 500 locations around the world, said Wayne Balta, vice president of corporate environmental affairs and product safety for IBM.For context, IBM has completed roughly the same number of upgrades, retrofits and updates annually for the past two to three years, he estimated.""Some of these projects are very substantial; others are more modest,"" Balta told GreenBiz.Going forward, that pace might be difficult to maintain, but the company’s team of more than 50 energy management professionals is always hunting for new opportunities.That includes setting minimum expectations for HVAC systems, building management systems, data centers and IT operations, cafeterias and central utility plants.When it comes to climate change, if you’re the atmosphere, there’s only one thing you care about, and it’s reducing emissions.Overall, conservation projects undertaken during 2017 reduced IBM’s overall energy consumption by 4.2 percent, or an estimated 143,00 megawatt-hours of electricity and 105,000 million British thermal units of fuel oil and natural gas, according to IBM’s latest report on its environment programs.When it comes to climate change, if you’re the atmosphere, there’s only one thing you care about, and it’s reducing emissions.That translates into a financial savings of $16.1 million on energy expenses, IBM estimated.From 1990 and 2017, the company conserved 7.4 million MWh of electricity, which helped it avoid 4.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.It saved $616 million along the way.Any location that uses more than 2,000 MWhs of electricity is required to keep close tabs on consumption, report on how it performs against a series of best-practices checklists, and come up with a strategic plan for closing gaps at least once every four years.That information is recorded in a performance management system that offers shared insights.""The analyses from these databases enable monthly metrics reporting to management and the identification of opportunities for improvement,"" IBM’s sustainability team writes in its report.""The continuous review of energy use and conservation performance has facilitated attainment of the strong results noted above.""As you might expect from an internet and cloud services company, a big chunk of IBM’s energy efficiency improvements last year came from optimization work within its data centers.For example, by consolidating computer servers and by using software virtualization technology to get more out of the systems it kept, it cut 90,000 MWh annually and saved $9.6 million.The company is also eating its own dog food, so to speak, by installing its Smarter Buildings technology, which enables managers to collect and analyze consumption more thoroughly as part of a cloud software application.In 2017, IBM added this system to 72 more locations; it has now been installed across 24 ""major"" campuses, representing a total of 227 buildings.Other more ""low tech"" solutions related to design saved 20,000 MWh related to cooling equipment and systems at 89 data center locations, according to the report.That included installing blanking panels that better control the air flow between racks of servers, investing in more cold-aisle containment systems and checking under raised floors to ensure that errant cables aren’t blocking cold air.IBM also shut down 140 computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units by raising the ambient temperature by approximately 2.5 degrees Celsius.""All of these things can change the efficiency question dramatically,"" Balta said.Like most big tech companies, IBM is on the hunt for more renewable electricity sources that can serve its power needs.Last year, it contracted to purchase about 779,000 MWh produced by a diverse range of generation sources — including wind, biomass, solar and small and large hydro plants.That translates into just under 23 percent of its total needs, which beats the company’s goal of reaching 20 percent by 2020.IBM does not count unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) against that total, because it ""obfuscates the need for hard public policy decisions and investments across the energy value chain that must be made to genuinely increase the quantity and availability of renewable electricity delivered to the grid,"" IBM’s team noted.Balta’s view is that IBM should strive wherever possible to directly consume the renewable electricity it buys.For that reason, the energy team prioritizes sourcing renewable electricity from ""accessible sources,"" with Europe and Latin America leading the way with the highest percentage of renewable electricity from contracted and grid-supplied sources.The company does factor bundled RECs in its renewable electricity metrics.It uses them to account for times when its facilities require more power than what is being delivered by solar or wind generating sources.""Our intent is to procure renewable electricity and its zero-emissions attributes from the grid regions in which our facilities operate, either by directly matching our physical consumption or using bundled RECs to offset emissions,"" IBM notes in its comprehensive discussion of this topic.While IBM is considering a new renewable electricity target — and it ""would certainly like to be able to power our operations with 100 percent renewable electricity"" — you shouldn’t expect to see it declare that commitment in the foreseeable future.IBM is unique in its position of counting hydro power as renewable.The company explains that position in its report: ""We report all of our contracted renewable electricity purchases – whether from new or existing generation sources, 'additional' or otherwise, without discriminating against large hydro installations — and their associated CO2 avoidance.Our rationale is that all purchases signal to suppliers our desire for them to maintain and broaden their renewable electricity offerings.""Or, as Balta put it, ""When it comes to climate change, if you’re the atmosphere, there’sonly one thing you care about, and it’s reducing emissions.""IBM actually has set three CO2 reduction goals since 2000.Its most recent one called for an emissions reduction of 35 percent by 2020, using 2005 as the baseline year.The company surpassed that goal near the end of 2016, and it reported a reduction of almost 43 percent for its managed locations.View the discussion thread.Get your copy Summer Rates Now Available"

https://bizplus.ie/big-blues-deep-thunder/,"17 Apr 2015 | 10.34 am 17 Apr 2015 | 10.34 am Businesses put out by the vagaries of the Irish weather can benefit from accurate forecasts.IBM, which has its Irish technology campus in Mulhuddart, west Dublin, says its Deep Thunder weather modelling system provides ‘hyper local forecasting’ – highly reliable weather forecasts for individual locations.IBM combines big data analytics and weather modelling technology for the system, which it has been testing it in the US for several years.Sean McKenna, a senior research manager at IBM’s Smarter Cities Technology Centre, says that while traditional forecasting methods can predict the weather with some accuracy, they don’t necessarily give weather-sensitive businesses information that firms can act upon.“What we do differently to traditional forecasts such as Met Eireann, for example, is specifically target a location,” says McKenna.“We provide very high resolution, very fine-grained forecasts both in space and in time, centred on a particular point.So the forecast could be centred on Dublin city centre or on a farming operation in Cork.” IBM believes that the system should interest wind energy producers.“Deep Thunder and additional IBM analytics predicts wind speed and direction, the temperature of the air, and analyses what this means on the output side for the amount of power a wind turbine is going to generate,” says McKenna.In the agricultural sector, Deep Thunder is driving what is known as precision agriculture.Typically, the technology uses sensors placed in fields to measure the temperature and humidity of the soil and air, and this combines with satellite imagery to produce real-time data.Crop maturity predictive analytics can be used to make informed decisions to increase yields.Dublin City Council has also been collaborating with IBM on Deep Thunder to predict flood events.Gerry O’Connell, an engineer in charge of the Flood Advisory office, explains: “IBM takes satellite imagery and combines that with the rainfall data.It gives us specific information on the flood risk areas of the city and that is linked into the drainage network.The grid areas that they work to are a lot smaller than those currently used by Met Eireann.As a result, the information is more detailed and more accurate.” In another climate-related initiative, the council has decided to step up its commitment to solar energy after IBM experts spent three weeks in the capital assessing the city’s potential to harness smart and green energy solutions.Dublin was one of 16 cities chosen to receive a ‘Smarter Cities Challenge’ grant from IBM in 2014, as part of the tech firm’s CSR initiative called ‘Smarter Planet’.The challenge for IBM in Dublin was to find a way of using 430 municipally-owned buildings and other council assets to harvest smart or renewable energy.The IBM team made six recommendations to the council, starting with the suggestion that solar panels be installed on suitable city-owned properties before installing them on housing complexes and leisure centres.One stumbling block in the deployment of solar technology is the lack of energy feed-in tariff (REFIT) schemes, which are currently only available for wind and biomass projects.Were it to be introduced for solar technology, IBM suggests, producers could sell solar energy back to the national grid.In its first response, the council plans to install solar panels at the Civic Offices and on four library buildings this year.The partly EU-funded initiative is costing the council €250,000 and it estimates savings of €21,000 on annual energy bills.But SME sector pays back more than it borrows Digital platform for ticket sales Free memory key when you subscribe to Business Plus magazine.© Business Plus | Web design by Isobar"

Search In the next five years, plastic recycling advancements like VolCat could be adopted around the globe to combat global plastic waste.People at the grocery store buying a bottle of soda or container of strawberries will know that the plastic they’ve purchased won’t end up in the ocean, but instead will be repurposed and put back on the shelf.Plastic waste is plaguing our planet.In total, people have produced more than 8 billion metric tons of plastic.Half of all newly manufactured plastic becomes trash in less than a year.By 2050, there is projected to be more plastic in the ocean than fish.PET is one of the most common manufactured plastic polymers (~10% of total plastics produced per year), a key ingredient in food and beverage packages and in the fibers of cloth.Historically, most of this material was not recycled, a primary reason that 8 million metric tons of PET plastics are estimated to go into the ocean each year.Advancements in plastics will enable plastic bottles, containers, and PET-based fabrics are collected, ground up, and combined with a chemical catalyst in a pressure cooker set to above 200 degrees Celsius.With heat and a small amount of pressure, the catalyst is able to digest and clean the ground-up plastic, and the process separates contaminants (e.g., food residue, glue, dirt, dyes, and pigments) from material that is useable for new PET.The useable matter (called a monomer) takes the form of a white powder, which can be fed directly into a polyester reactor to make brand new plastics.In the coming years, advancements like VolCat will make plastics recycling more efficient and more versatile in treating more material types than its predecessors.Unlike traditional mechanical recycling, future plastics recycling will break down both colored and clear plastics, as well as dirty and clean containers, producing a high-quality final product that is 100 percent recyclable.(Mechanical recycling can only be used on clear, pre-cleaned containers and results in a material that’s only reusable when combined with new PET).For people at home, future recycling advancements will mean no more sorting, rinsing, and separating used containers, wrappers, or plastics.All polyester waste can go directly into the trashcan and onto the curb for pickup, and from there to a recycling facility, to be digested and transformed into new and renewable material.In the next half decade, plastic recycling advancements like VolCat could be adopted around the globe to combat global plastic waste.People at

polyesters) into a substance which can be fed directly back into plastic manufacturing machines in order to make new products.VolCat begins by heating PET and ethylene glycol in a reactor with the catalyst.After depolymerization is complete, the catalyst is recovered by distillation from the reactor using the heat of reaction.The solution is filtered, purified, and then cooled, and the solid monomer product is recovered by filtration.The recovered liquid, along with the catalyst, is then reintroduced into the depolymerization reactor in an energy-efficient cycle.The team of researchers behind VolCat imagines the system being used at recycling and polyester manufacturing plants worldwide.Currently, polyester reactors are fed ingredients derived from petroleum.In five years, recyclers could cut out the fossil fuels, and simply attach a VolCat system to the assembly line and make new plastic directly from the old.Watch introduction Predictions Seed Harvest Shelf Plate Trash About

https://www.computerworld.com/article/2487947/ibm-solar-energy-tech-claims-to-harness-power-of-2-000-suns.html,"Use commas to separate multiple email addresses Your message has been sent.There was an error emailing this page.By Lucas Mearian Senior Reporter, Computerworld | PT IBM, working with other researchers, has announced an ""affordable photovoltaic system that can concentrate solar radiation 2,000 times.""A byproduct of the system is that it also produces a massive amount of heat.That heat can be harvested to perform other functions, such as desalinating water and creating cool air in sunny, remote locations where they are often in short supply, the IBM researchers said.The High Concentration PhotoVoltaic Thermal (HCPVT) system can convert 80% of the incoming solar radiation into useful energy.If IBM's claims prove true, its solar concentrator would surpass a recently achieved world record for solar conversion efficiency, which is 44.7%.That system, created by a team of scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems along with others, was able to concentrate power that is the equivalent of 297 suns.The HCPVT system uses a big mirror that looks like a satellite dish to concentrate sunlight onto a small semiconductor chip, which then converts that light into energy.Because of the high concentration, along with energy, heat is also concentrated and must be dissipated so it doesn't melt the system.That heat can be used for other processes, such as desalination (evaporating saltwater to make potable water), according to Bruno Michel, a lead scientist with IBM Research, Zurich.""The Sun is the [source of the] most abundant energy we have.We get 85,000 terawatts of energy [from the Sun] on the face of the globe, and we only need 15 terawatts,"" Michel said.""So we only need a fraction of .3 or .4% of the surface of the earth in order to provide all our energy.""So we could build a solar power station in unused land in the Sahara, for example, to provide enough energy in the long term to replace all of the fossil and nuclear energy,"" he added in a video describing the technology.The prototype HCPVT system includes a Sun tracking system that positions the dish at the best angle to capture the sun's rays.The mirror reflects onto several microchannel-liquid cooled receivers with triple junction photovoltaic chips -- each .39-in.x .39-in.chip can convert 50 watts, on average, over a typical eight-hour day in a sunny region.The entire receiver combines hundreds of the chips and provides 25 kilowatts of electrical power.The photovoltaic chips are mounted on micro-structured layers that pipe liquid coolants within a few tens of micrometers off the chip to absorb the heat and draw it away.The system is 10 times more effective than passive air cooling.""The coolant maintains the chips almost at the same temperature for a solar concentration of 2,000 times and can keep them at safe temperatures up to a solar concentration of 5,000 times,"" IBM said in a statement.The HCPVT was created as part of a three-year, $2.4 million grant from the Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation awarded to scientists at IBM Research;

https://observer.com/2015/10/google/,"Google joined forces with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to begin its “circular economy,” aiming to boost its work in renewable energy.(Getty Images) From kindergarten to college, Americans are inculcated with recycling values.Whether it was your first household chore or a daily classroom activity, separating paper from plastic makes us feel like we’re saving the world in some small yet significant way.But in light of a recent New York Times article by science columnist John Tierny and Google’s new “circular economy” project, the effects of recycling seem to be in question.Last week, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a nonprofit which helps large companies transition to a circular economy, announced that Google had become one of the several mega-corporations to help reduce waste by implementing a circular economy of its own.By design, a circular economy is restorative and regenerative, aiming to take materials like plastic and silicon out of landfills and eliminating wasted water, food and energy.A circular economy keeps products and their materials at their highest utility, getting systems to ultimately run on renewable energy.“We’ll be focusing on opportunities wherever possible to eradicate waste through smart design—at our data centers, in our kitchens, on our campuses, in all we do around the world,” Google’s sustainability lead Kate Brandt told FastCompany.Google did not return requests for comment.“Google’s ambition to lead the way on the circular economy represents a step-change opportunity – we are thrilled to be working closely together with such a visionary, innovative and transformational partner on this journey,” MacArthur said of the partnership.Google joins the ranks of Cisco, Unilever, Philips, Renault and Kingfisher among the many corporations labeled as the MacArthur Foundation’s “Global Partners.” This announcement comes at a time when the issue of recycling has returned to the controversial spotlight—is it or isn’t it helping to save the Earth?(Be careful of your answer, you have kindergartners’ dreams at stake here.)But it’s hard to ignore the facts that Mr. Tierny brought up in his column this past weekend, causing controversy among the religious ritual of recyclers.Listing off the amount of plastic and glass Americans would have to recycle in order to make a significant impact on greenhouse gases would make any avid recycler rethink their beliefs.Recycling one ton of plastic saves slightly more than one ton of carbon dioxide, while three tons of glass would give you about one ton of greenhouse benefits, according to the Times.Have we been throwing away our time on hopeless waste?Not entirely.Mr. Tierny also points out the positive effects of recycling.Recycling one ton of paper or metal (like aluminum cans) saves about three tons of carbon dioxide—a much more promising result.But New York City still has a long way to go if it wants to achieve Mayor Bill de Blasio’s “Zero Waste” proposal.Mr. Tierny notes the mayor’s recycling promise: By 2030, New York City will reduce its solid waste by 90 percent, no longer having to send garbage to out-of-state landfills.It’s an ambitious goal for the city—and Mr. Tierny’s sobering facts might make residents less motivated to follow through on their recycling habits.Much to the chagrin of devout recyclers, the chief environmental benefits do not come from our personal commitment to recycling, according to Mr. Tierny.Instead, the biggest impact comes from reducing the need to manufacture (which entails less drilling, mining and logging).Appearing on CBS This Morning on Tuesday, Mr Tierny stood by his facts, despite inevitable backlash that may come from devout recyclers around the country.“When it comes to the bottom line, both economically and environmentally, not much has changed at all,” said Mr. Tierny, who claims that not everything we recycle is worth the effort.So perhaps Mr. Tierny’s facts—although disappointing—have helped to pique the interest of big companies looking to delve into the circular economy.As an Internet and innovation powerhouse that already has a track record for its environmental consciousness, Google’s move to the next level of sustainability could make that big manufacturing impact—one that your recycling bin might not have the ability to do on its own.We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.To read our full stories, please turn off your ad blocker.We'd really appreciate it.Below are steps you can take in order to whitelist Observer.com on your browser: Click the AdBlock button on your browser and select Don't run on pages on this domain.Click the AdBlock Plus button on your browser and select Enabled on this site.Click the AdBlock Plus button on your browser and select Disable on Observer.com."
https://support.google.com/store/answer/2664771?hl=en," Because of certain substances used in electronic equipment, throwing out old electronic devices along with regular garbage can hurt the environment and even threaten human health.So the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires that these devices be marked with the above symbol, which reminds people not to throw away such items as unsorted waste.EU Member States are also required to achieve high levels of collection of these devices for environmentally sound disposal.The success of this policy will depend on the active contributions of people like you.So, before you toss your old phone or computer or other device, think for a moment.Could you reuse it?Recover it?Turn it into a sculpture?By extending the life of your device -- or at least returning it to a facility dedicated to its proper disposal--you’ll reduce waste and help the EU meet its goals.Distributors (like the Google Store) are also required to allow customers (like you) to return used electronic devices free of charge, as long as you’re swapping it out for an equivalent device which fulfills the same function as the equipment you return.This means that when you buy a new device from the Google Store, you can send us your old one and we’ll recycle it for free.Here’s how the program works: To return your item, follow the steps below: In accordance with Annex VII in the EU WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU, Google has identified the substances, mixtures, and components that have to be removed from separately collected WEEE associated with Google branded consumer hardware devices.Reuse and recycling facilities shall ensure that these identified substances, mixtures, and components are disposed of or recovered in compliance with Directive 2008/98/EC.Reuse/recycling facilities can request information about the identified substances, mixtures, and components requiring removal by sending an email to env-compliance@google.com"
https://gigaom.com/2011/12/27/whats-up-with-google-and-biomass-power/,"Out of all of Google’s (s GOOG) close to $1 billion in clean power projects, turning biomass into energy seems like the least relevant technology to Google’s core business.But Google has made a few small investments into biofuels and biomass to energy projects including a venture investment into CoolPlanetBiofuels earlier this year, and one I learned about this week: a project that turns waste from hog farms into electricity in North Carolina.The article about the hog waste project, which was published in the Los Angeles Times, says Google invested part of the $1.2 million it cost to build the project that uses bacteria to digest hog poop, burn methane to produce electricity and convert ammonia into nitrogen for fertilizer.Duke University and the farmer Loyd Bryant were the other financiers of the system.The article notes Google has a data center nearby, and Google will earn carbon offset credits from the system.Like some of Google’s other clean power micro investments, the project could be a way for Google to investigate ways to tap into distributed power in local regions, for either its data centers or offices.(There’s no indication this one in North Carolina will be powering anything Google related).Remember Google was the first customer for Bloom Energy’s fuel cell, which can use biofuel, as well as natural gas and biogas, to produce electricity.Google used the Bloom Energy fuel cells to provide power in a data center test lab.Distributed energy production could be a way for Google to manage and control power costs.Back when Google invested in CoolPlanetBiofuels, Google Ventures’ Managing Partner, Bill Maris, told me this: As a company, Google is interested in reducing all aspects of its environmental footprint.As a firm, Google Ventures is interested in contributing to this effort both on Google’s behalf and for the benefit of positive global impact.While petroleum does not constitute a large percentage of Google’s emission profile, we are enthusiastic about supporting technologies that can help us economically reduce our carbon footprint while simultaneously contributing to our domestic energy security.How do you think Google could use biomass and biofuel projects for its business?Image courtesy of eutrofication&hypoxia.Google has seen the Future……….and it looks like “Road Warrior”.Hi Katie, We are strong believers in “adaptive technology” which essentially is taking the best of what is already known to work, updating it with modern materials (where appropriate) and blending it with state of the art ancillaries such as communications and controls (again, where appropriate).Gasification for example is “old tech” first patented in 1788, yet is still to meet its full potential.Despite exciting advances being displayed in the late 19th & early 20th century’s with the technology making in roads into power, metallurgy, water pumping (with pumps that shifted 180 tons a minute, and ran for decades) and plans for innovative shipboard propulsion that did away with propellers.It was pushed aside by cheap oil and the convenience of petroleum fuels, briefly resurrected again in the second world war when there where shortages of these.Today well designed system are modular and therefore scalable, efficient at converting diverse solid organic materials from diffuse sources scattered across a region into a uniform, convenient form and has low or zero problematic emissions compared to straight combustion.Now for the Google angle…imagine within a given geographic region there is enough biomass (from waste, Ag-residues, management of environmental plantings or plantations etc) to operate 1000 x 100kWe gasifier power plants that are linked to the grid, effectively a “broad acre” 100MW power plant.Each system is managed either collectively by employed crews or individually by farmers/business owners.However they are controlled remotely over the internet by the utility using “smart grid” technology with which they can be brought up to full power or back to idle depending on electricity demand (leveling the output of wind farms for example).The individual managers only need to ensure routine maintenance and fuel supplies are maintained.There are too many threads of this weave for a short post, but the implications are profound across so many areas from socioeconomic through environmental, a true “enabling technology”.Cheers,
Peter @Peter, Thanks, interesting thoughts Actually it is about time, biomass is “stored solar” and as such the most flexible renewable energy source.The tech to access it is available in every country and generates permanent local jobs, not just jobs for the lowest paid and most exploited as for many “high tech” solutions.In Australia innovative developments with gasification will allow high efficiency, low cost plants able to form distributed power networks at farm and small commercial scales, cumulatively capable of generating gigawatts of power.This is an necessary category."

https://www.wired.com/story/google-and-facebook-backed-an-event-denying-climate-change/,"This story originally appeared on Mother Jones and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have publicly acknowledged the dangers of global warming, but last week they all sponsored a conference that promoted climate change denial to young libertarians.All three tech companies were sponsors of LibertyCon, the annual convention of the libertarian group Students for Liberty, which took place in Washington, DC.Google was a platinum sponsor, ponying up $25,000, and Facebook and Microsoft each contributed $10,000 as gold sponsors.The donations put the tech companies in the top tier of the event’s backers.But the donations also put the firms in company with some of the event’s other sponsors, which included three groups known for their work attacking climate change science and trying to undermine efforts to reduce carbon emissions.Among the most notable was the CO2 Coalition, a group founded in 2015 to spread the “good news” about a greenhouse gas whose increase in the atmosphere is linked to potentially catastrophic climate change.The coalition is funded by conservative foundations that have backed other climate change denial efforts.These include the Mercer Family Foundation, which in recent years has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to right-wing think tanks engaged in climate change denialism, and the Charles Koch Institute, the charitable arm of one of the brothers behind Koch Industries, the oil and gas behemoth.In the LibertyCon exhibit hall, the CO2 Coalition handed out brochures that said its goal is to “explain how our lives and our planet Earth will be improved by additional atmospheric carbon dioxide.” One brochure claimed that “more carbon dioxide will help everyone, including future generations of our families” and that the “recent increase in CO2 levels has had a measurable, positive effect on plant life,” apparently because the greenhouse gas will make plants grow faster.In a Saturday presentation, Caleb Rossiter, a retired statistics professor and a member of the coalition, gave a presentation titled “Let’s Talk About Not Talking: Should There Be ‘No Debate’ that Industrial Carbon Dioxide is Causing Climate Catastrophe?” In his presentation, Rossiter told the assembled students that the impact of climate change on weather patterns has been vastly exaggerated.“There has been no increase in storms, in intensity or frequency,” he said.“The data don’t show a worrisome trend.” He insisted that when he hears the news that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are rising, “I’m cheering!” That’s because, he said, carbon dioxide “is a fertilizer” that has made Africa greener and increased food production there, reducing human misery.Rossiter also claimed that carbon dioxide emissions correlate with wealth and that the greenhouse gas “improves life expectancy” because poor countries that start burning fossil fuels have a more consistent power supply and can then clean up their water.“I’m happy when carbon dioxide is up, because it means poverty is down,” he declared.“I come not to bury your carbon but to praise it,” he concluded.Rossiter’s presentation puts him on the far fringes of the climate denial world.Not even Exxon is trying to make such arguments anymore.And it’s a long way from what Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have said about the dangers of carbon dioxide; all three companies have committed to reducing their own carbon footprints.Microsoft has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 75 percent by 2030.Google claims to be committed to a “zero carbon” future and is aggressively pursuing renewable energy sources for its operations to reduce its carbon footprint and help combat climate change.And Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg criticized President Donald Trump after he announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, writing, “Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it’s too late.” The presence of the tech sponsors at a libertarian conference is not itself unusual, as governments around the globe move to try to regulate social media and online privacy.Tech companies see libertarians as natural allies in the fight against regulation.Indeed, Google sponsored two different sessions at the conference, one on why “permissionless innovation” needs to be defended and another on whether the government will “continue to let the Internet be awesome.” But the companies’ underwriting of a conference with a climate denier on the schedule shows the hazards of trying to advance a policy agenda through interest groups without also supporting their fringe elements.The CO2 Coalition wasn’t the only group sponsoring LibertyCon that is known for its work undermining efforts to combat climate change.Along with Facebook and Microsoft, the Heartland Institute was also a gold sponsor of the event.Heartland is a longtime player in industry-funded efforts to undermine climate science and fend off efforts to reduce carbon emissions.The conservative Heritage Foundation, which pushed the Trump administration to withdraw from the Paris climate accords and has long featured experts who argue that global warming is a myth, was also a sponsor.Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.A Facebook spokesman responded to questions about its sponsorship of LibertyCon by sending a link to its political engagement page, which says, “Sometimes we support events that highlight Internet and social media issues” and features a long list of third-party groups it has worked with in the past.He noted that LibertyCon met its criteria for support and cited the number of sessions unrelated to climate change.A spokesperson from Google defended the company’s LibertyCon sponsorship, saying, “Every year, we sponsor organizations from across the political spectrum to promote strong technology laws.As we make clear in our public policy transparency report, Google’s sponsorship or collaboration with a third party organization doesn’t mean that we endorse the organization’s entire agenda or agree with other speakers or sponsors.” A recent climate survey shows most Americans think climate change is a future problem.They're wrong.Here are the facts.CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast.All rights reserved.Use of and/or registration on any portion of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (updated 5/25/18) and Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement (updated 5/25/18).Your California Privacy Rights.The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast.Ad Choices."

Nicole Kobie In 2013, Facebook opened its first data centre outside the US in the Swedish town of Luleaa, which lies just 150 kilometres from the Arctic Circle Apple has solar panels in Chinese yak fields.And Google and Apple both claim to be 100 per cent carbon neutral.Last year, Microsoft sunk a data centre into the ocean, and last month, announced it was ahead of schedule to hit its target of 60 per cent renewable energy in its data centres and would get there by 2020, while settling on a new milestone of 70 per cent by 2023.That’s great.But there’s a but.Microsoft also doubled its in-house carbon tax to $15/ton, signalling it would boost that to $40/ton with its membership of the Climate Leadership Council — a controversial group that wants to give legal immunity to fossil fuel companies.That last point highlights how environmentally-friendly stories make for positive headlines, but risk obscuring the real achievements and challenges on building sustainable data centres.And failing to get it right could have real consequences.Analysts estimate that some 50 billion devices will be connected by next year — and to support all this tech, more and more data centres are being built around the world, rapidly becoming the biggest energy consumers on the planet.By
Matt Reynolds Research suggests about two to four per cent of carbon emissions are from computing, be it the internet or cloud computing or corporate data centres.The environmental impact could rise as technologies such as 5G, the internet of things and driverless cars mean more data is collected, analysed and stored.John Andresen, associate professor at Heriot Watt University, suggests that figure could rise above ten per cent in the next five years — though others predict it could be more.Despite that, you could be forgiven for thinking the problem was solved, or heading that way.Microsoft's company-wide aim is to cut its carbon footprint by 75 per cent by 2030, driven by doubling its in-house carbon tax.That carbon tax was started back in 2012 and is now in line with California's carbon pricing — it's also the reason Microsoft joined the CLC, as that organisation argues carbon taxes are the best way to cut emissions, though it also wants to avoid companies being held legally responsible for climate change.""This is all on the path to 100 per cent renewable energy,"" says Lucas Joppa, Microsoft's chief environmental officer.Last year, Amazon and Google both claimed to have already reached that goal, flipping entirely to renewable energy sources for their global operations, which includes data centres.But exactly what they mean by renewable energy is complicated.The energy comes from two sources: directly purchased and from the grid.The former involves long-term contracts that let companies buy truly renewable energy directly.A decade ago, Google bought all the electrical output from a wind farm in Iowa.Microsoft did the same last year, signing a purchase agreement with a wind farm in Ohio.Such projects spur investment in renewables, letting energy companies build wind farms knowing they have a long-term customer.""Such agreements give the supplier confidence of a market for energy over a period of time, and so make it easier for them to invest in new renewable energy projects,"" says Chris Preist, professor of sustainability and computer systems at the University of Bristol.""So, in regions where the political will is there, it will certainly result in the deployment of more renewable energy over time.""Or, as Joppa puts it, such contracts ""help green the grid"".By
Sabrina Weiss However, some percentage of Google, Apple and Microsoft's energy mix still comes from the grid.""After efficiencies, after direct purchasing of renewables, what's left we cover with renewable energy credits in the open market,"" Joppa says.Those renewable energy credits (RECs) are certificates that show an energy company generated renewable power and supplied it to the grid.To make the claim that they're carbon neutral, companies such as Microsoft or Google may buy the certificates when they have to draw energy from the national grid, as you can't trace the provenance of an electron bouncing around the grid.It's akin to any of us buying from a green energy supplier, but still drawing power from the same grid as everyone else; we feel like do-gooders, but it's purely metaphorical — the same amount of coal is being burned.Lars Schedin is the CEO of EcoDataCentre, and finds such green consumption certificates frustrating.""That doesn't minimise any carbon dioxide emissions,"" he says.""It only means that I, as a private person, get the [non-renewable] mix in my home.You haven't done any good at all.It's just fooling society that they are improving the situation when they are not.""Microsoft said most of its 60 per cent renewable-sourced energy was from direct purchase, rather than credits, but would not confirm the ratio.Google and Apple both acknowledged the use of RECs or equivalents in their sustainability reports.Apple noted in its report that as of January last year, 66 per cent of its renewable energy comes from projects it created — either those it owns, such as the solar panels on its headquarters, or long-term purchase projects — with the remaining third coming from local renewable energy projects.If that's not enough, then it turns to RECs, though it does require them to be in the same state as the data centre it supports.Apple breaks down the energy mix of its US data centres in its sustainability report, and that shows where real progress is being made.Its Newark, California data centre pulls from the grid, but via that state's Direct Access system Apple can buy directly from suppliers.There, it claims its energy is ""mostly wind"", and takes that to mean there were no emissions.On the other hand, its Reno, Nevada data centre is 99 per cent powered by Apple's own solar panels, with less than one per cent from purchase agreements — there's no question where the power is coming from.Google, meanwhile, buys or generates more carbon-free energy than it uses at any given moment in its data centres, to make up for times when it needs to turn to the grid for more power.In one example, a data centre in North Carolina was 55 per cent carbon-free in April, 82 per cent carbon-free in September, and 49 per cent carbon-free in December, largely owing to a seasonal decline in solar-power generation — it's darker in winter, after all.By
Chris Stokel-Walker Those gaps were made up with excesses of Google-contracted solar power; there's more than it needs in sunnier hours of the day, so that power is pumped onto the grid.That means Google's data centre is still run on some carbon-based energy from the grid during darker hours, but it tries to displace that with cleaner energy for others during the day.Google's aim is to be entirely carbon free, but at the time of the report in 2017, in regions where purchasing agreements were signed, the reality was closer to 65 per cent, with none of its data centres fully matched at all times with totally carbon-free sources.In short, when a tech company says its data centre and other operations rely entirely on renewable energy, it's actually a complicated mix of clean energy generated from their own buildings, renewable power projects they've signed long contracts with, and credits or excess power to fill the gaps.Whether that latter category counts as truly renewable or not will impact whether you think those 100 per cent claims hold water.Of course, there are other ways to cut carbon emissions in data centres beyond buying cleaner energy, in particular around efficiency.""Reduce and renewable should be our mantra,"" says Preist.Schedin points to three considerations: efficiencies, reusing heat, and, as above, the source of energy.The tech industry is getting better with efficiency.As Joppa explains, the cleanest energy is the energy you don't use — handily, it's also the cheapest, hence the investment into everything from reprogrammable chips to data centres powered locally by fuel cells.Andresen says more than half of the energy chewed through by a data centre is for cooling.""All the electricity going into the boards is converted to heat,"" he says.""For every unit of energy you put for data, you need 1.2 units for cooling — that's normally by fans.""This is why Microsoft sunk a data centre off the coast of Orkney in Scotland — it's sealed in a shipping container, so don't fret about the servers drowning.""Because the sea is only four degrees, it's kind of self-cooling,"" says Andresen.This is why cold climates (such as Iceland or Sweden) are so popular for data centre companies.If your servers are too hot, just pump in some cold air from outside.By
Amit Katwala But that causes another problem.""All the heat they are generating, they're just throwing it out the window,"" Schedin says.""You can actually see changes in the microclimate around big data centres.If you're looking to have palm trees in the northern part of Sweden, then that's good, but if you want to maintain the current climate in northern Sweden, then you should force data centres to reuse the heat somehow.""Heat generated by data centres at Schedin's company heat local buildings in the winter, while in the summer the excess warmth is put to making wood pellets, which he describes as a combination of wood shavings, pressure and heat.""Pellets are nothing but 100 per cent energy,"" he says.""Once you produce them they're easy to store.In the wintertime, when it's really getting cold, you burn those pellets instead of using oil or gas.""That further helps reduce carbon emissions in the wider community, but excess heat could be used to warm or power any local building, with Schedin suggesting colocating anything from a greenhouse to a brewery next to data centres.That's similar to Andresen's own project, which uses non-conductive liquids to cool the servers.""There's nothing new in that, but we can use that fluid for something useful,"" he says, explaining that it can hold heat up to 60 degrees Celsius.""It's enough to heat up water for homes.""The project is based in Malaysia, which needs cooling more than heat, but there the hot liquid is used to power a heat pump to generate power.Using that excess heat saves emissions created elsewhere — it's a real carbon credit — but such systems are rare, says Schedin.Aside from improving efficiency and reusing heat produced by a data centre, the third consideration Schedin says is the source of power, as above.But even with solid progress in long-term purchase contracts and generating their own clean power, there's still an environmental debt that needs to be counted.Building a wind farm or solar panels requires power and leads to carbon emissions, after all.Schedin calculates that into his firm's energy efficiency score, but most others don't.""They say that now they're using wind power, it's carbon neutral from the very beginning — no, it's not, sorry guys,"" he says.""It has an environmental debt from the very beginning – they forget about this part of the calculation because it's not their debt, it's the construction company who has the debt.""None of this belittles the progress made by the tech industry switching its data centres to renewable sources and cutting power use through technological and cooling efficiency — that should all be applauded, Microsoft included.""The work they do is genuinely useful, making them one of the leaders in the corporate world,"" says Preist.""But we all need to up our game.""Despite the headlines suggesting 100 per cent renewable sources and the innovations such as sunken servers, there remains an alarming amount of work still to be done.– The WIRED guide to the best sci-fi movies ever made – Why Tim Cook is a better Apple CEO than Steve Jobs – The UK's MPs are on the verge of mental breakdown – WIRED Recommends the best backpacks Get WIRED Weekender, your at-a-glance roundup of the most important, interesting and unusual stories from the past week.In your inbox every Saturday by 10am.by entering your email address, you agree to our privacy policy By

warm the atmosphere and cause climate change.The city-level leaders overseeing this task won’t have the same tools available to their national peers.Most of them won’t have an Environmental Protection Agency (or its equivalent), a meteorological bureau, a team of military engineers, or NASA.So where will they start?Never mind how to reduce their city’s greenhouse-gas emissions; how will they know what’s spewing carbon dioxide in the first place?Maybe Google will do it for them.Or, at least, do it with them.Google has started estimating greenhouse-gas emissions for individual cities, part of what it recently described as an ambitious new plan to deploy its hoard of geographic information on the side of climate-concerned local leaders.“The first step toward taking climate action is creating an emissions inventory,” says Saleem Van Groenou, a program manager at Google Earth.“Understanding your current situation at the city scale, and understanding what you can do to it—that’s an information problem, and that’s a good place for Google to sit.” So far, the company has only released estimates for five cities, including Pittsburgh, Buenos Aires, and Mountain View, California.It plans to expand the program gradually to cover municipalities worldwide, but has declined to provide more specific plans.“What we envision is an open search bar for users to search for their own city in the future,” Van Groenou told me.As part of this initiative, Google says it will also release its proprietary estimates of a city’s annual driving, biking, and transit ridership, generated from information collected by its popular mapping apps, Google Maps and Waze.The company has never released this kind of aggregate transportation data to the public before, and it says it may share even more specific types of data with individual local governments.“This information has historically been really hard to get a hold of,” Van Groenou said.“But this is precise data, like looking at the ‘red-yellow-green’ traffic in Google Maps and aggregating it up for an entire year.” Google made the announcement earlier this month as part of the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco.The summit, organized in part by California Governor Jerry Brown, was meant to encourage states and cities that have advanced climate policy since President Donald Trump took office.These local programs do much, but they have not replaced climate policies revoked by Trump: A recent report from Yale and a number of European think tanks found that these “subnational” programs could make up about half of the United States’ pledged carbon cuts under the Paris Agreement.Google has framed the new project, called the Environmental Insights Explorer, as a way for leaders to focus and improve local climate programs.The victims of climate change are already here.The explorer remains a better tool for getting a glancing sense of a city’s carbon emissions than it is for making meticulous policy.Right now, it can only estimate carbon emissions from electricity and transportation—two important sources of pollution, but not the only ones.Heavy industry and agriculture, for instance, generate roughly a third of U.S. emissions.Google is also hampered by the age and quality of some data: To estimate how much carbon is emitted to power a given city, it must use a six-year-old data set from the EPA.But it can still provide useful information.In Pittsburgh, for instance, it estimates that the power grid drives more than three times the emissions as the transportation sector.The situation is reversed in Buenos Aires, where cars and trucks produce twice the pollution created by the electricity grid.“This is not sufficient information to decide whether to build another tunnel underneath the Hudson.We don’t know that yet.But we can say that in Buenos Aires, you should probably focus on transportation as opposed to building emissions,” Van Groenou said.The tool can further help would-be city planners imagine a more eco-friendly city.If Pittsburghers took an extra 1 million trips a year by bike instead of by car, they would prevent almost 700,000 tons of carbon dioxide from spewing into the atmosphere.The project also integrates some data from Project Sunroof, a Google program that aims to make it easier to install rooftop solar panels.Local governments may be most excited about Google’s plan to release some ridership data.This will be the first time that Google has publicly estimated how many car trips occur to, from, or within a city every year.(There are about 547 million total in Pittsburgh.)Mike Gardner-Sweeney, the transportation director for the city of Boulder, Colorado—one of the few cities in the country with a carbon tax—said there was “definitely a lot of interest” from municipal managers in getting this type of Google data.Though Boulder uses a variety of technologically advanced methods to estimate travel time, the Google Maps and Waze data would augment both its real-time and more long-term sense of road use, he said.(Boulder is not working with Google at the moment.)The EPA prepares the gold-standard estimates of greenhouse-gas emissions for the United States.But these figures do not extend to the local level.Google is “not here to compete with the EPA in any way,” Van Groenou said.In fact, the company cannot duplicate U.S.-level carbon estimates right now, because it would double-count all trips between two municipalities.But Van Groenou told me he hopes that Google can help cities better understand their own climate situation—particularly since having a shared method of estimating emissions would let cities in different countries compare their climate policies.“The bottom line is that this is not something that Google can do alone,” Van Groenou said.“This is a communal thing.This is something we have to come together to make any change on.” We want to hear what you think about this

https://gizmodo.com/how-google-microsoft-and-big-tech-are-automating-the-1832790799,"In a deal that made few ripples outside the energy industry, two very large but relatively obscure companies, Rockwell Automation and Schlumberger Limited, announced a joint venture called Sensia.The new company will “sell equipment and services to advance digital technology and automation in the oilfield,” according to the Houston Chronicle.Yet the partnership has ramifications far beyond Houston’s energy corridor: It’s part of a growing trend that sees major tech companies teaming with oil giants to use automation, AI, and big data services to enhance oil exploration, extraction, and production.Rockwell is the world’s largest company that is dedicated to industrial automation, and Schlumberger, a competitor of Halliburton, is the world’s largest oilfield services firm.Sensia will be, according to the press release, “the first fully integrated digital oilfield automation solutions provider.” It will enable drilling rigs to run on automated schedules, enhance communication between oilfield equipment, and help machinery assess when it is in need of repair or modification—all in the name of making drilling for oil smarter, cheaper, and more efficient.As the Chronicle put it, Sensia will “help producers churn out more oil and gas with fewer workers.” Which, of course, is precisely the opposite of what needs to be happening in regards to the churning out of oil right now.The specter of catastrophic climate change has never loomed so large.The most recent major United Nations report by the world’s top climate scientists concluded we have just over a decade to draw down emissions to the point that we might avoid runaway climate change and the soaring temperatures and rising sea levels that will accompany it.And yet, the biggest and most influential tech companies are making deals and partnerships with oil companies that move the needle in the opposite direction.Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have all struck lucrative arrangements—collectively worth billions of dollars—to provide automation, cloud, and AI services to some of the world’s biggest oil companies, and they are actively pursuing more.These deals, many of which were made just last year, at what may be the height of public awareness of the threats posed by climate change, are explicitly aimed at streamlining, improving, and rendering oil and gas extraction operations more profitable.These deals weren’t secret and many have been openly reported in trade journals and business sections, but somehow big tech’s sweeping embrace of the oil industry has managed to escape wider notice and criticism.Advertisement “It is indeed disturbing to see the tech industry helping move civilization back into the fossil age even as they purport to be about cutting edge technology intended to lead us into the future,” said Dr. Michael Mann, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State.“It ultimately speaks to the amorality of corporate interests.” While Google, Microsoft, and Amazon may put on a progressive air towards climate change and extol their own clean energy investments, they are in reality deep into the process of automating the climate crisis.Google recently drew criticism for spending $25,000 to co-sponsor a conference, along with Microsoft, which featured groups that promote climate change denial.Yet Google itself is helping fossil fuel companies utilize a wide range of its technologies to get oil and gas out of the ground, which will, undeniably, accelerate the process of climate change.Last year, Google quietly started an oil, gas, and energy division.It hired Darryl Willis, a 25-year veteran of BP, to head up what the Wall Street Journal described as “part of a new group Google has created to court the oil and gas industry.” As the VP of Google Cloud Oil, Gas, and Energy, Willis spent the year pitching energy companies on partnerships and lucrative deals.“If it has to do with heating, lighting or mobility for human beings on this planet, we’re interested in it,” Mr. Willis told the Journal.“Our plan is to be the partner of choice for the energy industry.” Just last year, Google Cloud and the French oil giant Total “signed an agreement to jointly develop artificial intelligence solutions for subsurface data analysis in oil and gas exploration and production,” according to the trade outlet Rigzone.The division also inked a partnership with Houston oil investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, which the Chronicle noted “will give Google a more visible presence in Houston as one of its oldest industries works to cut costs in the wake of the oil bust and remain competitive as electric vehicles and renewable power sources gain market share.” (In case that wasn’t clear, yes, this partnership is touted as helping oil companies staying competitive against renewable energy companies.)Google also struck major deals with the oilfield services company Baker Hughes, and the aforementioned Schlumberger.It even entered into talks to build a tech hub and data centers for Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s incomprehensibly massive oil company.Advertisement Finally, to close out its year of courting the oil and gas industry, Google closed a deal with Anadarko Petroleum.As the Financial Times reported in December, “Google and Anadarko Petroleum, one of the largest US exploration and production companies, are using artificial intelligence to analyse large volumes of seismic and operational data to find oil, maximise output and increase efficiency.” So, Google is using machine learning to find more oil reserves both above and below the seas, its data services are streamlining and automating extant oilfield operations, and it is helping oil companies find ways to trim costs and compete with clean energy upstarts.It’s barely worth noting at this point that precious little, if any, DNA from Google’s Don’t Be Evil days persists.Still, it’s striking to see Google transforming itself into a veritable innovation arm of the fossil fuel extraction industry—at precisely the time when an understanding that climate change poses an existential threat to populations across large swaths of the globe has never been more acute.It may perhaps come as less of a surprise that Amazon too has an Oil & Gas division of its omnipresent Web Services division (AWS), and that it is unabashed in pitching its services to fossil fuel producers small and large.Amazon, after all, has long badly lagged among tech companies in adopting renewable energy and sustainability measures.It did, however, just announce Shipment Zero, a “vision” for reducing and offsetting its shipping emissions to “net zero.” Yet Amazon also hosts a detailed web page courting fossil fuel companies, which opens with the following pitch: “AWS allows Oil and Gas companies to streamline and reinvent complex, customized IT workflows to thrive despite low prices, shrinking margins, and market volatility.Explorers can extract deep insights faster to improve field planning, geoscientists can run more demanding HPC workflows and identify potential reservoirs faster and cheaper, and refineries can optimize production with predictive maintenance and predictive inventory planning.” Also unsurprisingly—given that AWS provides web services to a considerable portion of the entire internet—it has some high-profile clients in the oil majors, including BP and Royal Dutch Shell, as well as other players like GE’s oil business.Like Google, Amazon’s service promises to help fossil fuel companies harness AI—”AWS advanced machine learning and HPC tools allow oil and gas companies to reduce the time required for seismic data processing from several months to a few days”—and automation: “Accelerate deeper geological insights to improve decision making in exploration and production, and yield more productive oil extraction.Automate time-consuming processes, and achieve results with greater accuracy.” Amazon appears just as eager to move further into the lucrative fossil fuels business, to deploy machine learning and automation to help oil companies maximize their extraction and production capabilities, and thus maximize carbon emissions at a time when it seems imperative that companies be focused on doing the opposite.To top it all off, Amazon itself recently became an actual oil company.Advertisement Bill Gates is one of the world’s leading philanthropists.He heads a $1 billion climate action fund and has published his own point-by-point plan for fighting climate change.Notably absent from that plan is “Empowering Oil & Gas with AI,” which was, word-for-word, the theme of Microsoft’s 2018 exhibition at the Abu Dhabi International Exhibition & Conference, one of the largest global events for the oil and gas sector.“AI, leveraging of the intelligent cloud and edge computing ... these manifest in better reservoir characterization, optimized drilling, reduced downtime, and safer operations to mention a few,” a Microsoft director said at the conference.Meanwhile, the firm Gates founded is two years into a seven-year deal—rumored to be worth over a billion dollars—to help Chevron, one of the world’s largest oil companies, better extract and distribute oil.“Chevron is a very sophisticated consumer of data, compute and IoT,” Tom Keane, head of global infrastructure for Microsoft Azure, the company’s cloud services department, said in a press release when the deal was announced.“While they’re excellent today at high-performance computing, the intent of this partnership is, ‘How can we bring that together with Microsoft Azure and more efficiently do oil exploration?” How indeed.Microsoft Azure has sold machine vision software to Shell, and is powering its all-out “machine learning push.” It has helped BP build an AI tool to help determine how much oil in a given reserve is recoverable.And Microsoft’s data services are helping XTO, a subsidiary of Exxon, “to gain new insights into well operations and future drilling possibilities.” Microsoft Azure has also partnered with Equinor (formerly called Statoil, it’s Norway’s state-owned oil company), to provide data services in a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Advertisement Honestly, the list goes on—and every single one of those endeavors is actively working against the very ventures and climate action plans Gates is proposing on the philanthropy circuit.Silicon Valley’s mythology has always been predicated on the notion that its firms and founders would behave differently, and more aspirationally, than the industries of old.“Changing the world,” while always a notably unspecific mantra, was supposedly intended to precede “into something better.” But industries don’t get any older than fossil fuels.And they don’t get any worse for the climate.The science couldn’t be clearer.Fossil fuels need to stay in the ground, as much as possible.It might actually be accurate to say that the very last thing the world needs is an advanced AI that can better detect new oil reserves.Or a machine learning program that can squeeze more carbon-rich gas out of an underperforming well.Or rig machinery that works flawlessly in tandem with a network of other automated drilling rigs until the sea levels rise high enough to flood all their sensors.I am not sure how Google’s mission of indexing all the world’s information came to contain the side quest of helping the world in which it sits burn.Or how Bill Gates can talk about fighting climate change at Davos while his company props up and propels its actual largest contributors.(The most impactful move Gates could probably make at this point would be to ask Microsoft to cut ties from the fossil fuel industry.)Or how Amazon can advertise services aimed to optimize the obtaining and burning of carbon with the same blase copy with which it advertises Kindle self-publishing services.These companies, the climatologist Michael Mann says, have a responsibility to use their capacity for innovation to mitigate the climate crisis, not worsen it.“Under Eric Schmidt’s leadership, Google was doing just that.It appears that they have lost their corporate moral compass,” he says.“As I have commented before, it appears that Google dropped the ‘Don’t’ from their original motto.” I reached out to each of these companies and asked them point blank whether they considered it ethical to build AI and automated systems, to provide data services to the companies that are actively accelerating climate change.Not a single one even bothered to respond.Advertisement To reiterate: We’ve never had a better, fuller grasp of how dangerous climate change is—if you need more info, Google it.And yet our most powerful and admired tech companies appear content to use their cutting edge innovations to exacerbate what is likely the most dire threat to human civilization for a reward as dull and depressing as a share in the oil money.Maybe this is how Silicon Valley exceptionalism finally really ends—not with a scandal, or a burst bubble, but a quiet, slow-rolling merger with Big Oil.This story is part of Automaton, an ongoing investigation into how AI and automation is reshaping the human landscape.For tips, feedback, or other ideas about living with the robots, I can be reached at bmerchant@gizmodo.com or on Twitter.Advertisement Advertisement"
https://sea.mashable.com/science/2029/microsoft-google-and-facebook-sponsored-climate-change-denial-event,"Uh oh, looks like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook have been hypocritical.While promising to fight climate change, the three tech giant who were supposed to be committed to the cause are now accused of funding a political student conference, LibertyCon.LibertyCon is well known for promoting climate change denialism through its events, talks and paraphernalia.But what is even more shocking are claims that Google had funded US$25,000 while Facebook and Microsoft had chipped in US$10,000 to the event.And the tech giants were among the largest donors for the event which saw infamous climate change denier Caleb Rossiter deliver a talk where he claims to cheer whenever he reads reports on the rise of Carbon Dioxide.According to this report, visitors who attended the event were handed out pamphlets explaining how the earth gets better through more carbon dioxide.""More carbon dioxide will help everyone, including future generations of our families"" one of the pamphlet allegedly reads.The pamphlet is inspired from the CO2 Coalition - a non profit organization backed by oil and gas giant, Koch Industries.Yes, they are the same folks responsible for pushing United States President Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change accord.But what exactly was the motivation for these tech giants to go back on their words?The Mother Jones claims that it is to do with the regulation on technology companies.Meanwhile, Google has defended itself by claiming that funding the event was to ""promote strong technology laws"".Facebook on the other hand has pointed to a page on the company's stance on issues political engagements where it claims to support events that highlight internet and social media issues.Microsoft claims it is still committed to sustainability despite the allegations made against it.“Our commitment to sustainability is not altered or affected by our membership or sponsorship of an organization.We work with many groups on technology policy issues and do not expect or anticipate that any organization’s agenda will align to ours in all policy areas,"" Microsoft says.Oh boy, it's definitely going to take more than mere statements to convince people.is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking."

https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/12/google-environmental-sustainability-data-kate-brandt,"Google’s sustainability officer Kate Brandt outlines the company’s wide-range interest in sustainable fishing, green buildings and renewable energy Ucilia Wang Wed 12 Oct 2016 20.27 BST Last modified on Wed 14 Feb 2018 17.08 GMT For many people, Google is simply the gateway to a vast archive of facts and memories.For those who pay closer attention to its business dealings, the company also invests billions to find new ways to use the power of computers: it’s developing robots, virtual reality gear and self-driving cars.Remember all the hubbub about Google Glass?Google has been using the same approach in sustainability – spreading its wealth in a variety of projects to cut its waste and carbon footprint, initiatives which may one day generate profits.During the SXSW Eco conference this week, I caught up with Google’s sustainability officer, Kate Brandt, to find out more.Brandt joined the company in July last year after serving as the nation’s chief sustainability officer in the Obama administration.During her keynote at SXSW Eco in Austin, Texas, Brandt hit all the key environmental initiatives that Google had undertaken over the past decade – at least those that have been announced.Some of the projects involve collecting and analyzing data that enable Google and other businesses to use more sustainable materials, reduce their environmental impact and cut emissions.“When we think about the Third Industrial Revolution and the role Google played in it, we also think about the Fourth Industrial Revolution where this digital backbone could transform our relationship to the material world.We would like to be a player,” she said during her keynote.The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the buzzterm for describing the deepening role that technology plays in our lives.Understandably, Google is big on reducing energy use at its data centers.Another often-cited effort: the company is a big wind and solar energy investor, having signed 2.5 gigawatts worth of contracts around the world and, additionally, committed to investing $2.5bn in renewable energy, including owning stakes in power plants.That makes the company the largest corporate renewable energy buyer if you don’t count utilities, Brandt said.Brandt wouldn’t tell me whether the company plans to put money into energy storage, which is seen as a complementary, if not must-have, technology for renewable energy in overtaking fossil fuels.Energy storage, such as batteries, makes it possible to use renewable energy at a time when solar or wind farms can’t produce electricity.The energy storage market is fairly new, with lots of experiments with a variety of technologies and ways to reduce costs.Brandt said one of the surprising things she learned when she first arrived at Google was the company’s project to create a database of the composition and environmental impact of building materials, something she didn’t know about before.The company had been using the database, called Portico, for its own construction projects, but released a web app last week to make the data more publicly available.Brandt isn’t the first hire at Google to work on sustainability.The tech giant has a decentralized approach: there have been teams embedded in different business units that look at ways to reduce energy use, emissions and waste and to boost productivity and revenues.For instance, there’s a team called Geo for Good that investigates the use of maps, data and machine learning to solve environmental problems, such as creating databases and software to monitor the health of tropical forests around the world or track illegal fishing.There’s also a team that works on serving sustainably grown food within the company.But Brandt appears to have been hired to come up with big picture strategies and make more efficient use of all these disparate sustainability initiatives.That means a lot of cajoling and negotiations with people who don’t necessarily have to answer to her.This is where her experience working as the country’s chief sustainability officer comes in handy, she said.“My current role [is to work] across a lot of different teams.These challenges are so big that it requires partnership,” she told me.What Google does internally is fascinating.At a sustainability conference in June, I attended a panel of three Google employees who recounted their effort to promote reusable menstrual cups, which help to reduce the amount of pads and tampons that end up in landfills.The discussion provided an interesting look into the skepticism and struggle the three women faced in persuading their fellow Googlers to try something new.And, of course, data played a big role: numbers to show the growing public interest in menstrual cups and the large expenses that Google spends on pads and tampons.They ran a pilot project at the company’s headquarters in Mountain View that saw all 250 cups being used in half of the expected time frame and received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback.So the Googlers began looking to do another pilot at a different Google office.I also learned that reducing meat consumption is a touchy subject at Google, where engineers are pampered and cloistered to maximize their productivity.“When we did ‘Meatless Monday’, there was a group that set up a barbecue just outside of the café,” said one of the Google employees at the June conference.So what does Brandt do personally to set a good example?“I take our shuttle to work,” she said, before switching to “we” and her talking points from her keynote.“We are focused on composting, recycling and reusing our water bottles,” she said, pointing to a water bottle on the table in front of her.“We have a bin that’s green for composting, blue for recycling and a little bit of [space] hanging off to the side that’s for landfill waste.”"

https://qz.com/1267709/every-google-search-results-in-co2-emissions-this-real-time-dataviz-shows-how-much/,"The important stories of innovation across the continent’s wide-ranging economies In-depth coverage of the world’s largest democracy for India and its far-flung diaspora Lifestyle, culture, and living well in the new global economy Management news, advice, and ideas for business leaders Create, share, and discover charts, using the same tools as the Quartz newsroom Every Google search comes at a cost to the planet.In processing 3.5 billion searches a day, the world’s most popular website accounts for about 40% of the internet’s carbon footprint.Despite the notion that the internet is a “cloud,” it actually relies on millions of physical servers in data centers around the world, which are connected with miles of undersea cables, switches, and routers, all requiring a lot of energy to run.Much of that energy comes from power sources that emit carbon dioxide into the air as they burn fossil fuels; one study from 2015 suggests internet activity results in as much CO2 emissions as the global aviation industry.“Data is very polluting,” says Joana Moll, an artist-researcher whose work investigates the physicality of the internet.In 2015, to illustrate the environmental consequence of Google searches, Moll created a data visualization called CO2GLE: (Click here to launch “CO2GLE” and see a real-time counter.)“Almost nobody recalls that the internet is made up of interconnected physical infrastructures which consume natural resources,” Moll writes as an introduction to the project.“How can such an evident fact become so blurred in the social imagination?” CO2GLE uses 2015 internet traffic data, Moll says, and is based on the assumption that Google.com “processes an approximate average of 47,000 requests every second, which represents an estimated amount of 500 kg of CO2 emissions per second.” That would be about 0.01 kg per request.She says these numbers are approximations, though when Quartz shared CO2GLE with Google, the company didn’t contest the math.In fact, in a 2009 estimate, Google said each query causes 0.2 grams of CO2 emissions.A spokesperson also tells Quartz that providing one user with one month of Google services generates about the same amount of the greenhouse gas emissions as driving a car for one mile.(An average gasoline-powered car typically emits 8.91 kg of CO2 per gallon.In the US, cars average 24.7 miles per gallon, which would mean a car emits 360.7 grams of CO2 per mile.)That said, scientists are still not clear on exactly how much greenhouse gases search engines emit.One estimate from British environmental consultancy Carbonfootprint puts it between 1g and 10g of CO2 per Google search.The high end of that estimate accounts for having to start up your computer before running the search, but even the low end is higher than both Google and Moll’s relatively conservative estimates.Google is mindful of its carbon footprint (pdf).It’s designing more energy-efficient data centers, investing in clean energy, and has numerous carbon-offset programs.The company’s spokesperson emphasizes that Google has been carbon neutral since 2007.But this doesn’t erase the fact that Google’s infrastructure emits a considerable volume of CO2.Speaking at the IAM Weekend conference in Barcelona last week, Moll showed another visualization, which she calls “DEFOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOREST,” to drive home the point.For every second spent on Google, 23 trees have to use up their CO2-sucking abilities.(Click here to launch “DEFOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOREST.”) Moll’s research focused on Google because of its scale, but other websites also contribute to the internet’s carbon footprint.Facebook, for instance, reported that its data centers and business operations resulted in 718,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2016, which is comparable to the annual CO2 output of about 77,500 US homes running on electricity.“What I’m really trying to do is to trigger thoughts and reflections on the materiality of data and materiality of our direct usage of the internet,” Moll says.“To calculate the CO2 of the internet is really complicated.It’s the biggest infrastructure ever been built by humanity and it involves too many actors….[But they are] numbers that can serve to raise awareness.”"
https://www.wired.com/story/how-google-keeps-power-hungry-operations-carbon-neutral/,"Kate Brandt has a radical idea for how we’ll have to live in the future, if we’re going to be in balance with nature.She envisions a world without landfills, where ownership is obsolete, and everything down to the socks on our feet is rented and shared.Brandt is Google's sustainability officer.And she’s obsessed with one idea: the “circular economy,” which aims to eliminate waste.This would require products and materials to be kept in use, rather than thrown away, and for the world to be powered by renewable energy.At Google, Brandt is employing this ethos at scale.At TEDWomen 2018, a conference for women thought leaders in Palm Desert, California, this week, she issued a challenge to the rest of the tech industry to do the same.The timing is good—and necessary.A recent report from the US government paints a dire picture of what will happen to our planet if we don’t aggressively counteract climate change in the next decade.That’s in line with the UN’s report from October,which concluded that humans have about 12 years to reverse current trends before we do irreversible harm.Brandt is focused on implementing this vision at the buildings that house Google employees and at Google’s 14 data centers around the globe.The company has been carbon-neutral since 2007, which requires a lot of work to offset its substantial power demands.Google achieves this three ways, according to its most recent Environmental Report: by reducing its demand, by buying renewables to match its use of non-renewable energy, and with other offsets, like capturing methane gas from animal waste.Data centers are a large source of emissions.According to a recent report in the journal Nature, data centers use 200 terawatts of energy a year—roughly 1 percent of global electricity use.Google estimates that each search emits roughly 0.2 grams of CO2 into the atmosphere, due to the energy it takes to power the cables, routers, and servers that make Google work.That's on par with the energy it takes to power a lightbulb for 17 seconds.Watching or uploading a video to YouTube is worse for the environment: 1 gram of carbon for every 10 minutes of viewing, according to The Guardian.Experts estimate that internet companies put out as much CO2 as the airline industry.1 As Google grows, “We are committed to neutralizing all the carbon emissions associated with our operations,” Brandt says.That sounds great, but how do you actually do it?“First we applied machine learning to the cooling of data centers,” Brandt says, cutting energy use by the cooling system by 30 percent.Google designed servers that will last longer and be easier to reuse.“We are taking components from old servers, and we are keeping them in our new machines.We’re remanufacturing new servers from old ones.And we sell old servers on secondary markets after wiping them clean,” she says.In 2017, that meant 18 percent of Google’s new servers were remanufactured machines, and 11 percent of components used for machine upgrades were refurbished inventory.The company sold more than 2 million used machines to others.Google also bought 3 gigawatts of wind and solar last year to offset the energy use of its data centers, allowing the company for the first time to match 100 percent of its energy use with renewables.Though that tactic has long been a component of its carbon-neutral effort, 2017 was the first year it was able to buy enough clean energy to offset all its data center energy consumption.“For every kilowatt-hour of energy we consume, we add a matching kilowatt-hour of renewable energy to a power grid somewhere,” Urs Hölzle, a Google senior vice president, wrote in a blog post earlier this year.Google is far from alone in embracing the circular economy.Nike, Brandt points out, is designing out waste in how it harvests materials and makes products.She points also to Renault and Walmart as companies embracing reusable materials and 100 percent renewable energy, respectively.“But no one else in the data center industry is applying this circular approach at scale,” she says.Though she doesn’t call them out specifically, streaming services could have a huge impact if they answered Brandt’s call, since streaming services like Netflix account for a majority of global broadband traffic.Greenpeace has singled out Netflix for not making commitments to reduce its climate impact.Amazon has taken heat for not being open about its sustainability efforts and climate impacts, recieving an F rating in 2016 from the Carbon Disclosure Project, which called it out as the largest US company to refuse transparency.Netflix and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.Microsoft doesn’t call it a circular economy approach, but it’s been making big strikes on sustainability for the past six years.Microsoft created an internal carbon tax to help reduce its emissions.Since implementing it in 2012, the company has been carbon-neutral, and it has pledged to cut its absolute emissions by 75 percent by 2030.The good news is that the circular economy is an idea whose time may have come.The urgency of recent climate reports has led not just a handful of companies to embrace the idea of renewable and circular manufacturing, but also countries.The European Union’s parliament embraced it this year and is considering advancing broader circular economy goals.Japan and China are both introducing circular goals into their economies.Getting more businesses to buy in is a hard ask.But it’s potentially a profitable one.“Today we have so many materials that are used once.There is still so much intrinsic value that is left in those materials, but we aren’t designing them to retain that value,” Brandt says.She points to a recent study estimating that if industry embraced a circular economy, it could boost economic output by $4.5 trillion by 2030, by cutting down on the cost of buying new materials in favor of reusing and remanufacturing existing materials.There’s a symmetry to that year: It’s the deadline after which the UN estimates humans will not be able to recover from the climate impacts we’ve had on Earth.By embracing the circular economy, Brandt hopes humans can mitigate disaster without even losing money in the process.1 CORRECTION, Dec. 1, 8:10 PM: An earlier version of this story

https://www.euronews.com/2018/05/08/meet-the-artist-raising-awareness-about-google-s-carbon-footprint,"world news Share this article Ever wondered how bad your Googling is for the environment?Probably not.But Catalan artist-researcher Joana Moll has and in 2013 she kicked off a project to visualise the greenhouse gas emissions generated through the use of the search engine.The project CO2GLE shows a counter clocking up an estimate of the amount of CO2 emitted with each Google visit.“The project was created from an urge to highlight the invisible connection between actions and consequences when using digital communications technologies,” reads the introduction.According to the website internetlivestats.com, Google processes 3.5 billion searches per day.A 2016 environmental report by Google said the tech company’s greenhouse gas emissions were 2.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.This is the equivalent of the yearly greenhouse gas emission of over 620,000 cars.When people talk about the Internet being a “cloud” they actually refer to the global network of data centres and the fibre cables connecting these centres, a spokesman for the British environmental consulting agency Carbon Action Fergal Mee told Euronews.These data centres demand a constant supply of power that can come from fossil fuels, which emits carbon dioxide as it burns.A 2015 study found that internet activity was approaching a similar level of CO2 emissions as the global aviation industry.“In short the power comes from the electricity grid unless a data centre makes its own electricity.Therefore as internet use increases more data centres shall be required and hence more power stations,"" said Mee.""It does not look good for the environment.” To build the project, Moll gathered data from researchers that estimated the amount of CO2 emissions Google queries generate and combined it with internet traffic data from internetlivestats.“For me it’s not about showing precise information because it’s impossible to obtain but it’s about triggering thought and reflection in that direction because it’s quite dramatic that the equation of transferring data is harming the environment.It’s not embedded in the social imagination — nobody thinks about it and it’s quite impressive,” Moll told Euronews.I don’t want to criminalise Google, I chose to use them in my project because they are the most used platform in the world, she added.Moll has expanded on the topic and is now working on other related projects.She is focused on the environmental impact of interface design and teaching people to act more sustainability, she said.Share this article"
https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/environment/your-plan-your-planet-how-reduce-your-environmental-footprint/," If I told you that freezing your leftovers, using the dishwasher (instead of washing dishes by hand), and turning down your water heater just a few degrees could help protect the environment, you’d probably think it sounds too simple.But it turns out that our greatest impact on the planet comes from just three things: our food, water, and energy usage.And if we each made a few small changes, we could all make a big difference.Sustainability is at the core of many of Google’s initiatives, from millions of square feet of LEED certified buildings for our employees, to mapping solar potential for homes and cities, to building public transit routes into Google Maps.These efforts can be achieved when you put the resources of a company behind them, but it’s equally important to empower individuals to take action.We’ve teamed up with the California Academy of Sciences to create Your Plan, Your Planet—an interactive way to understand your environmental impact and learn simple, science-based ways to improve it.Easy ways to make food last.Things you can do to slow your flow Simple things to zap those energy hogs.Sometimes it’s the smallest things that make the biggest difference.Your Plan, Your Planet can help you get started.Follow Us"
